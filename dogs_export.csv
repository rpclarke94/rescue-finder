Oscar came to SDR when a family member developed allergies to his fur which resulted in asthma.


Oscar has settled in well to the routine here at SDR and is happy to see the dog carers for a good fuss and a cuddle. One thing he doesn't like is being left, he can become a little vocally demanding until you come back for more cuddles. He does however settle in time and relaxes on his bed.

Food & Treats - Oscar is a bit of a chunky lad, so at present, he is fed on a weight-control biscuit. He does like his food but does not bolt it down, he is well-mannered when taking treats but can sometimes be a little bit pushy, wanting more.

People & Personality - Oscar can be a little shy when he first meets someone new, but this very quickly passes (particularly if treats are involved) and before you know it, he's your new best friend. He has a fabulous personality which comes shining through the more time you spend with him.

Traveling & Vets - Whilst here at SDR Oscar has been on a short journey to see our vets, He was a little unsettled in the van and did whine while on the journey. Having arrived at the vet he was quite well-behaved to start with the vet and assistant giving him a fuss. Unfortunately, when the vets wanted to examine him, he wasn't quite as happy, he did growl at the vet when they tried to listen to his heart and check his teeth. We did muzzle him for the examination, but this made matters a little worse, with Oscar trying to pull the muzzle off. When the examination was all finished Oscar went back to his happy self with the vet giving him a fuss.

Out & About - Oscar does like to go for a walk, he gets rather excited when having his harness fitted. Once out he does tend to pull somewhat on the lead and being the size he is, you certainly know about it. He loves to take in all that's around him having a good sniff of the fauna and flora. He is not fazed by passing traffic and happily carries on enjoying his surroundings.

Dogs & Cats - Oscar is very vocal when meeting new dogs and because of his size, some dogs find him quite intimidating. Oscar couldn't live with another dog, but he could (in time) have some canine buddies to go walking with. Introductions would have to be done gradually and well controlled. We have also introduced Oscar to our resident cat and again he was very vocal when he caught sight of her. Our Resident cat (Clove) is very used to meeting dogs and was not concerned about his barking, choosing to bop Oscar on the nose, just to let him know who's boss.

Garden & Fencing - Oscar is most certainly going to need a garden, we have found that he does not like to toilet on concrete and prefers to go on grass. He will need a good-sized garden for him to have a play and run around and a 6-foot secure fence.

Oscar's new family - Oscar is looking for a new family that can keep up with his high demands for entertaining him. He can be left for up to four hours, but this will need to be built up gradually and he will need to be let out to the toilet just before you leave and as soon as you arrive back home. Oscar loves his walks so his new family will also need plenty of energy to keep up with him. 

Oscar will require a minimum of two visits from all members of the household ahead of the adoption process.


The adoption fee for Oscar is £250.00

Brie was handed into SDR back in 2022 as her owner couldn’t cope with her care alongside her daughter's needs.  She suffered from fur patches missing from her coat which sometimes bled and were very itchy.

After many vet appointments and a referral to a skin specialist, she is now looking a lot better and is finally ready to find her forever home.

 

WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT BRIE?

Loves people
Knows basic commands and walks well on the lead
Full of enthusiasm and enjoys mental and physical stimulation

A home with a secure garden
An active home that will keep her physically & mentally stimulated
A home with no other pets

She will need medication and management for her skin for the rest of her life, which also includes special food.  Potential owners will need to bear this in mind.  Brie has been seeing a specialist vet and may need an appointment there in the future. We will go into more detail with potential new owners.

Beautiful & gorgeous are words banded around when people meet Joules, and don’t get me wrong she most certainly is.  The only other words missing are bonkers, crazy and bouncy.  As anyone who has owned a boxer type before will no doubt testify.  This lovable breed are in a league of their own when it comes to full on madness.  Joules came to us as she was a little too much for her previous family.  She has lived with children and was well mannered, if somewhat excitable when around them.

Peach arrived at SDR via another rescue.  She hasn't had the best luck being found as a stray originally. She didn't have any history but was clear from the start she has a strong working instinct to herd, even if it's her own kind. After spending six months at another rescue in Birmingham she was sadly overlooked but hopefully she will have more luck in finding her home here in the countryside - we hope that a change of audience will help Peach find the home she truly deserved.

WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT PEACH?
Already has some basic training
Playful and sociable with people once she knows you
Loves playing football
Muzzle trained
Highly intelligent and will enjoy further training
Calm and relaxed in her kennel
If you are her ‘person’ she is affectionate and leans into you for fuss

Knight arrived as a stray after a member of the public found him in the woods; scared and emaciated.  Knight did his 'stray time' with the local pound and then came back to us.  It took a while to build him back up to a healthy weight and now you wouldn't recognise him as the same dog.

Rally was originally signed over to SDR in January 2024 after a sudeen change in her owners circumstances.  We knew she wouldn't be with us long as she is a wonderful girl who is very well trained and was adopted less than a month later.  Sadly due to her owner becoming unwell, Rally was return in March this year.  Having not been exercised due to her owners illness, Rally had piled on the pounds.  She has lost a whopping 10kg since being back with us and is almost at her target weight.

If you live in rented accommodation, in addition to the completed pre-adoption questionnaire please include written permission from your landlord or housing authority, confirming that they are happy for you to keep a dog in the property. If you already have a dog/s the permission must state the number of dogs allowed – without this we cannot include the application.

If your application is successful then you will be contacted within 48 hours.

 

ABOUT OCEAN

In March 2025, Ocean was found by a member of the public and taken to SDR in very bad shape.  She was emaciated, had infected wounds, and suffered from severe hypothermia. Thanks to the care she received at Crossroads Veterinary Centre, as well as the ongoing love and support from the team at SDR, Ocean made a full recovery and now she is unrecognisable from the sad, emaciated dog she once was. 

 

WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT OCEAN?
Super affectionate once she trusts you and loves cuddles
Enjoys interacting with her handlers
Loves going out for walks and adventures
Muzzle trained
Good at the vets
Enjoys training and enrichment which helps her confidence

 

WHAT OCEAN NEEDS…

Most of you know Hope and her story by now, for those who don’t here is her story. She arrived to us through a member of the public who found her on the side of a road and upon arrival it was clear she was in early stages of labour, later that day she was rushed to the vets for an emergency C-section. Although 4 pups were delivered only 1 had survived, later to be known as baby Brian. Hope was a fabulous mum to him, and he eventually flew the nest, and it was now time to focus on getting Hope better. We managed to get her skin looking healthier and she even had BOAS surgery to help her be able to breath, which she has now fully recovered from, so finally she is ready to have her happily ever after in a loving home.

 

Personality – Best way to describe Hope would be, incredibly friendly and loving to all that thrives on fuss but “a bull in a China shop”, this girl has no sense of her weight and strength, often knocking and jumping into you or anything in close space, meaning your legs and fragile items will not be safe. She doesn’t purposely mean any harm but the impact from her does hurt (she will not be suited to anyone with mobility problems). Her personality is just that of a goofy, crazy and nuts character that never fails to make us laugh.

 

Exercise & Training – Coming in as a stray we are unaware if Hope has ever lived in a home, this will mean new owners will need to expect putting all basic training, including toilet training. Although she has had BOAS surgery to help her breath better, its still recommended that her exercise times are kept short and sweet. New owners will need to be extra cautious in warmer climates. To help keep her out of boredom we recommend focusing more on mental enrichment.

 

Other Animals – We have tested Hope around a few different dogs, overall, she isn’t bad but not great either. She does better with calmer dogs, but we wouldn’t trust her off lead with them. When tested with dogs who are more excitable, she can become reactive to them, and the same out on walks if there is a reactive dog she will likely react back however if they remain calm, she still may stare but she will quickly lose interest and carry on walking. We will be looking for a pet free home.

 

Type of Home/ Owner Experience – We do feel Hope would be best in a quiet environment as she does become noise sensitive and it does work her up. We will also be looking for a home that has access to an enclosed garden with at least 5ft fencing. Hope will require someone who has owned a bully breed before or has a good amount of knowledge about the breed.

 

Hope really is fabulous character to have the pleasure of looking after, if you didn’t know her story you wouldn’t believe what she has been through as she has just been so forgiving, and she does put a smile on everybody’s face that she meets, having the true ability to make your day a lot brighter.

 

The adoption fee for Hope is £250.00

Sadly after 6 years he has had to come back to us due to his adopters’ ill health.

He is a little overweight but as he’s now getting plenty of exercise we are sure this will help him get trimmer.

We were told he has not been around children and not lived with other dogs.

He has had no issues since being back with us and loves his walks and cuddles.

Pip would possibly suit someone on their own who wants a companion but happy to let him potter around and enjoy his walks

It does appear he likes plenty of attention but on his terms and will let you know when he has had enough with a nip.

We have not experienced this within the kennel environment but do have information from his previous homes."

When we first heard about Sammie, she was in a dog pound with one of her back legs hanging uselessly. A very kind lady was able to get her out & sent her straight to a vet clinic, where it was discovered that she was an older lady, who also had some mammary tumours & bad teeth. After some xrays to find her leg had been badly crushed years ago & scans to check the cancer hadn't spread, she had her first surgery, which was the leg amputation & neutering. Following a month of recovery, she had her second surgery, a double mammary strip & dental. She stayed at the clinic for 4 months in total, until she was fit enough to travel.

Since arriving with her foster, nearly 2 months ago now, she has made fantastic progress with rehabilitation. Sammie needed to lose some weight, gain back her balance, flexibility & muscle tone. She is now down to 14.5kg & with the help of a fantastic physiotherapist from Baldock, Jennifer Lucas, is looking much more comfortable as she's hopping along.

Sammie is very friendly with people, loves a stroke & a gentle cuddle. She politely meets other dogs on lead & shares her foster home with 2 or 3 but in an ideal world, she would like her very own human to adore & be adored by.

This extra special lady, will need an extra special home. She can manage steps in & out of the home but shouldn't attempt stairs. She will need either carpeted flooring indoors or rugs & runners on hard flooring so she's less likely to slip & fall.

Sammie wants to be as independent as possible but she does need help into & out of the car & someone who is able to get on the floor with her & pick her up if needed. She is limited to 10 to 15 minutes of exercise, twice a day, due to damage & arthritis in her front legs but it's really important that she does keep moving & keep her weight down. The speed she can reach hopping up the garden with her foster sister is impressive!

It's hard to put into words, the strength of spirit this lady has. She survived for years, with the pain of a useless, crushed leg & other associated injuries, probably from being hit by a car. Yet she's been incredibly trusting of vets & other strangers, allowing all handling, without complaint. She's grabbed her second chance at life with all 3 paws & wants to enjoy every minute, whether it's chasing up the garden, relaxing in the shade while her human works in the garden or snoozing in a comfy bed in front of the tv.

Fine with children. Not cat tested but this maybe possible to arrange"

We think this could help with her confidence.

The difficulty is, she won't make friends with other dogs instantly, it took her about a week to stop baring her teeth at the other dog in the foster home and a few weeks on, they're now besties!


If you're looking for a little velcro dog then Molly is the one for you! She is a typical clingy dachshund who forms a strong bond with her owner/s and wants to be with them ALL the time.

Molly is a tiny 5kg and is currently fed a raw diet which she's doing very well on.

She is a little poppet and a total lap dog who just wants to have cuddles, belly rubs and all your attention. She is learning to play with toys and enjoys chasing a ball.

Molly lacks confidence and is looking for a patient and understanding, adult only home with people who will get her out and doing things, to help her realise the world outside isn't as scary as she thinks.

She will bark at people entering the home and is quite wary of new people and other dogs when out walking, this is being worked on while she's in foster and she's making great progress.

Molly also needs some lead work as she will mostly only walk in one direction (straight forwards) and doesn't like being redirected! Like most darling daxies she can be a bit stubborn!

She can be left for short periods of time but when you get back she will be SO excited to see you that she will do a little excited wee and will then jump and run about because she's so happy. She gets the zoomies and dances about when it's time for bed.

Molly would love a home where she can be with someone most of the time.

Adults only. Okay with cats"

He does like to bury his head into your body for a stroke and loves to roll on his back for a tummy rub. He is already an excellent family dog, and with a little more nurturing on walks and jumping up to greet people or when he is excited. He can be a little boisterous on occasion but rarely barks and is quite relaxed in his foster home.

He's very good in the home, loves the garden, where he runs up and down with his squeaky ball, which is favourite toy. He's crate trained for nighttime, travels well in the car & has been taken on holiday in the UK by his foster home, where he had a lovely time exploring lots of new walks.

Penn is quite strong on lead, he can be both traffic & dog reactive on lead, which in his case, means lunging at passing cars, cyclists, scooters etc in particular so this will need more work. He has lived with other dogs in foster before, so we believe he would be fine with a female dog already in the home, pending successful meeting.

He will need an experienced, adult household, who are willing to put in the time to train him and provide plenty of exercise and stimulation. Penn is a very bright boy, he just needs the right environment to help him shine.

She came into our care after her previous owner, sadly, became too unwell to look after her. Now, she’s ready to find a loving forever home where she can continue to grow in confidence.

Luna absolutely loves human company. She enjoys her walks and, although she can pull for the first few seconds, she soon settles and trots along happily (sometimes in a little zigzag pattern – she’s still perfecting her lead manners!). Out in the world, she takes everything in her stride – traffic, wildlife, and even busy walks don’t phase her.

She has previously lived with dogs and seems comfortable around them, but she hasn’t lived with cats. Luna has also lived with a child around 11 years old, so she may suit a family home with older children.

Playtime is one of her favourite things, especially when a ball is involved. Her recall can sometimes take a back seat when she’s having fun, so adopters could help her practice in an enclosed field.

In the kennels, Luna does find being left alone a bit worrying and may howl if she feels lonely, so she’ll need a home where she isn’t left for long periods to begin with. She can also be startled by loud noises, but with time, love, and reassurance she’ll grow more confident.

The best thing about Luna? She’s a gentle, affectionate girl who wants nothing more than to be by your side, enjoying cuddles, walks, and adventures.

If you’re looking for a loyal companion who’ll bring joy and love into your life, Luna could be the one for you.

In many ways, Peppa is the perfect dog  – she is quiet and undemanding, loves her food, she doesn’t bark and shows no signs of aggression; she loves other dogs – large and small – and is most comfortable in their company, therefore we are looking for a home for Peppa where she can be with another dog.  Peppa loves the outdoors, and trots along beautifully on the lead.
Peppa’s new owner will need to be patient and understanding: she is a nervous girl, easily startled, and given the chance, she will try to run off.  She is small, fast and agile and will need a garden that is absolutely secure and owners who are vigilant in closing doors and gates.  Peppa will take some time to settle and get used to new people, because of this we are looking for an adult only home with limited visitors for Peppa.
If you are looking for a dog to cuddle, you’ll need to be patient, perhaps for many months.  She will follow you around, but will shy away from outstretched hands and cuddles, and run from you if she feels crowded – her new owner will understand this and wait patiently for the moment when she is comfortable enough to snuggle up, and it will happen!
Peppa is a delightful little dog with so much to give, but the rewards of taking her into your home will come later. Please do not be swayed by her cuteness and her amazing story, which touched us all, but do please contact us if you can provide the very special home that Peppa’s needs.

She has had a poor start in life so will need a family who is willing to continue her training and give her the extra socialisation that she needs.

She could live with other animals and she could live with children as well.

We don’t know Matilda’s exact breed but she is a terrier type breed.

At just over a year old, he’s full of playful energy and has a lot of love to give but he can find being on his own a little overwhelming at times.

He’s looking for a home where someone is around most of the time to help him build confidence and learn that independence can be a positive experience. Basil would benefit from continued training and routine to help guide him through his teenage phase — he’s still very puppy-like in many ways!

Basil may be able to live with another well-matched dog of similar size, pending successful introductions, and could live with older, dog-savvy children (secondary school age and up).

Ideally, his new owner will have experience with large breeds or be confident in handling bigger dogs. With time, consistency, and plenty of positive encouragement, Basil will make a brilliant companion.

If you’re ready for a bouncy best friend with bags of potential, Basil might be just the one for you.

**Basil currently weighs 41.2kg**

These places are a living hell and poor Chester spent his days making himself as small as possible and hiding away trying to be invisible.
Luckily, he was spotted by the team at PPTF that took him off to their private shelter and from here, he was transferred to us at Oakwood Dog Rescue to begin his new life.

Chester is a very timid boy that doesn't yet have any trust at all with people. He is going to need a calm and patient home with lots of love, time and understanding.

With dogs: Chester has been amazing, playful and respectful of every dog that we have mixed him with at the rescue.

Charlie's Story:

Charlie is a small boy that was really struggling in the shelter in Romania.

Upon arriving at Oakwood, he was very skinny and straight away showed signs of food guarding from the other dogs.

Dogs really have to fight for survival in the shelters as they are fed minimal amounts of food which is just tossed into the pens. For this reason, Charlie has learnt to guard any food from other dogs and this is the reason he is still alive.

Charlie has also shown signs of food guarding from people too as we went to move an empty food dish so any children in the home must ensure Charlie has his own space anytime food is around and to not go near him as sadly, this would likely not end well.

Any children living in the home must be very sensible and not put Charlie into a position where he feels he will need to guard.

Prince's Story:

Prince is a timid soul that was rescued from the horror's of a Romanian shelter.

He was shut down in the shelter and just too scared to do anything. If the shelter volunteers needed to do anything with him, they said he'd just completely freeze, let them do what they needed, and then run off back to a cold corner of the concrete pen he was living in, and try and make himself small and invisible.

Prince is not yet ready to accept strokes but from him watching the other dogs interact with us, he seems like he's really close to trying it."

Introducing... Rusty! 

Are you looking for a fluffy ball of fun? Then Rusty may just be the dog for you!!

Rusty's Story:

Rusty is approximately 8 years old and has sadly spent around half of his life living in a public kill shelter in Romania. He arrived in the UK November 2023.

About Rusty:

Rusty was very scared upon his arrival at Oakwood and he quickly showed us that he was not enjoying the company of other dogs so we moved him to be on his own. This is when his personality really started to show and this goofy little fluff ball appeared, started asking for fusses and making us laugh as he'd bound up and down the corridor with a big grin on his face. 

Rusty was adopted back in November 2024 but was sadly returned after just 4 weeks. Unfortunately, this really affected him and he was depressed for weeks, it was just heart breaking to see.

Rusty's cheeky personality has slowly started to shine back through but he's not quite the same dog as he was when he left us for his new home.

He is more nervous of us, flinching at every move we make, even when we are as slow as possible and showing him exactly what we are doing.

He used to be a dream on the lead with no reactivity to dogs or traffic, these days he can be reactive to dogs and some traffic he's not phased by, but randomly a certain vehicle will terrify him and he's throw himself to the ground and panic. Rusty is very food orientated so he can be snapped out of this but we are trying so hard to get the old Rusty back that we once knew.

Rusty needs someone with patience and understanding and we hope that the loveable goofball that we know is hiding in there somewhere, will gleam back through once he realises again that he is safe again and there is nothing to worry about."

Beyonce's Story:

Beyonce is just 11 months old and has spent her entire life living in shelters in Romania and at Oakwood Dog Rescue.

We had a plea from a volunteer rescuer that had just been at the shelter that she was living in stating that there were 2 pups there that were completely withdrawing into themselves and were starting to shut down. They were very worried that these 2 babies wouldn't survive the winter as they were already so frail, and temperatures had already dropped to -5 degrees. It usually gets to -20 during their winter months.

In the photos, Adele [her sibling] is attached to Beyonce's side. Over time though, these 2 girls have made many new friends and are no longer reliant on each other. They both now kennel share with different dogs and are settled and happy with their groups. We have given them playdates recently but unfortunately, it sees that they have grown apart and no longer enjoy each others company.

Beyonce has now started enjoying strokes from staff and some volunteers and we are so proud of her for this. With time and understanding, Beyonce is going to thrive in a home of her own.

Beyonce has never lived in a house before and so will require time, patience, understanding and lots of positive based training to help her learn the ropes of home life.

Carrie's Story:

Are you looking for a new best friend? Then look no further than Carrie!

Carrie has recently arrived with us at Oakwood and with her sweet personality and kind nature, we are hoping she is not going to be with us too long before she finds her forever home.

We were contacted about Carrie as she was being held in shelter in Romania where she was getting picked on by the other dogs. She is a large girl and so was in with lots of other large dogs, but this gentle girl wanted nothing more than to be out of that enclosure and to be with the volunteers that showed her kindness.

We were told that the volunteers had spent a couple of hours with Carrie and when it was time to go back into the enclosure, she was shaking and holding on to them, pleading with her eyes, to not be put back. We were told that she was not coping at all and she is one of the dogs were they would expect to one day be notified that she had been attacked and didn't survive :(

We couldn't let this gentle soul stay there any longer and agreed to accept her into our care.

Carrie is very human and dog friendly but can be very nervous until she gets to know you. She is very scared of the world around her and is not yet ablet to walk on a collar and lead due to fear. She loves playing with dogs, loves her food, and is starting to copy the other dogs and play with toys <3

Maudie came to us after spending a long time living in a public kill shelter in Romania. 

She was a very timid girl that - until arriving at Oakwood - had received next to no positive interactions with humans. 

She now has the confidence to ask the staff, and most of the volunteers, for strokes. She absolutely loves her fusses but she can take a little time to trust strangers enough to allow them to stroke her too.

Maudie is looking for a quiet home, with a patient owner and we believe that she will absolutely thrive in a home environment with lots of 1-1 time which is what she's currently craving."

Ralph!

Ralph's Story:

Our handsome boy Ralph, where do we start with his story..

Ralph was rescued back in March 2021 from a kill shelter in Romania. He was adopted shortly afterwards but was returned 12 days later. Ralph was a very nervous boy and he needed time to settle in and feel safe, something that he sadly he was not given.

Shortly afterwards, he was offered a place at a different rescue as they believed that he'd be snapped up quickly and this would give us a space to rescue another dog that was facing euthanasia.

Unfortunately, Ralph was overlooked time and time again and spent a very long time at this other rescue. They decided to give him another chance elsewhere and knew he'd thrive in a different environment with lots of new dogs to play with.

Ralph became very attached to the staff and started being a bit naughty with the other dogs, warning them off and not letting them near his human friends. This behaviour started getting worse and so Ralph came back to Oakwood to see if he could reset himself and start enjoying being around dogs again. So far, he has made lots of dog friends that he loves spending his days with but we don't interact with him whilst he is with them just to prevent any previous issues from arising.

Ralph will be staying with us for the foreseeable future and we will actively be looking for the best retirement home for him.

Ralph has never had his own home and family before which is just heart breaking so we need to make sure we find the perfect forever home for him. Could this be you?

Hey guys, Bobbie here!

I originally arrived at Oakwood back in Janurary 2021. When I first arrived I was very scared due to how mistreated I was in Romania. It took me a while to begin to trust people again but I managed to find a home in March 2021. 

In the home I was very loved and the last 14 months I was there I made lots of progress in so many ways. Sadly, I have now come back to Oakwood due to compatibility issues with my family. I am an incredibly loyal boy and tend to bond strongly with one person. For this reason I would prefer a 1 person household that I can give all my love and attention to. The humans said they understand what a huge ask this is though so they will also be happy to look at a 2 person household too, it just may take me a little longer for me to feel safe with meeting 2 new people at the same time. Unfortunately I can really struggle with new people and introductions need to be very slow so that I feel safe - but I promise that I will be the bravest boy and do my absolute best as I really do want nothing more than to meet my forever family.

Once I trust you, I guarentee that you will have a best friend for life.  My ideal home would have minimal visitors.

I'm a lazy boy who enjoys snoozing in my comfy beds, don't let that fool you though because I am super clever really! I enjoy enrichment and love my snuffle & lick mats. I also really enjoy obedience and trick training and it seems to entertain the humans when I show off all the cool tricks I know. I also love a blast on our big field, especially with my girlfriend Alex <3"

Chihuahua cross Chinese crested & Chihuahua

2-3 years old

This bonded pair of little dogs have been through so much together and have formed a great friendship here at the rescue
They both have ‘issues’ like being frightened of people…

They must have a very understanding home, a quiet lifestyle, someone with compassion, time and patience

Please don’t apply if you are looking for a ready made sociable dog, as they need a home where it’s all about what you can do for them

They are both wonderful little characters but will bond with one person to the detriment of all others..

Ideally a single lady who doesn’t have a busy social life,  and just wants to give something back for the love and devotion of these two little characters.

Very worthwhile

Both from sad pasts"

Pointer cross 2 years old

Luke has been returned to the rescue after 8 months in his first home, after becoming over protective of his family.
There may have been subtle signs of this happening, that were missed,  and allowed him to continue making his own mind up which led to this.  He is a such a young friendly boy, we are hopeful an experienced adopter will see his potential, and offer him a good life with no children,  or a too busy household with lots of comings and going’s,  as he will be better with adopters that have time and commitment and can show leadership and kindness.

He will relish a steady approach to training and knowing what’s expected of him and he will make a faithful companion

Support from the rescue,  including offer of behaviourist trainer to recognise any signs to work on will be provided

Very worthwhile

Yorkies approx 6-7 years old

We have decided to try and find these lovely sweet girls a home together as they have been through so much and Doris really relies on Dot for her courage

Both are small- Dot weighs 2.5kg and Doris is under 4kg so someone used to tiny breeds a plus point

Both are now spayed and vaccinated and are looking for a loving, local home where they can experience a home life for the first time in their lives

They must have an adopter who is at home most of the time to help them bond and get used to being handled

Doris is particularly skittish and afraid of people and will need a steady approach to training and time patience and routine to get her used to being handled, she is so desperate to be loved but lacks the confidence to relax until she has built up a lot of trust

A safe secure home and garden a must due to their nervousness, and an adopter with a quiet lifestyle willing to put in the commitment required to be their saviour and show them how good life can be

No small children

Very worthwhile

French Bulldog

4 years old

Bea has been under the care of one of our senior vets due to issues with a very sensitive tummy

Now receiving the right diet and supplements, Bea has blossomed and her tummy issues have resolved

Her adopter must be willing to carry on with the regime which is extremely easy going forward

Bea does NOT like other dogs and will need to be an only dog

She’s very sweet with people and will make a lovely companion for someone who likes to be left alone on walks and just enjoys the company of their dog

Bea is now spayed and vaccinated and her health is flourishing

Support will be offered by the rescue for life

A great little character but must have someone with knowledge of brachycephalic breeds for her safety and well being

Meet Magnus, a strikingly handsome German Shepherd with a heart of gold and a sweet, affectionate personality. Magnus absolutely thrives on human attention—he loves nothing more than being close to people and will happily try to become everyone’s best friend. He’s even a star at the vet, taking everything in his stride with charm.

Magnus is super intelligent and full of potential, but he’s also a strong boy who will benefit from ongoing training and socialisation to help him channel his energy in the right way. He’s especially enthusiastic when he sees other dogs—he means well but can get a bit overexcited, so he’s still learning how to stay calm in those moments.

His playful side really shines when he’s out in the field, where he happily chases his beloved penguin toy or a football with joy and enthusiasm. To keep him happy and fulfilled, Magnus will need a home that can offer plenty of enrichment, structure, and love.

With the right guidance, Magnus will be an incredibly loyal and rewarding companion.

Meet Ringo, a delightful 11 ½ old Labrador Collie cross with the heart of a puppy and the charm of a true gentleman. Ringo brings joy to everyone he meets—his affectionate cuddles, playful energy, and lovable personality never fail to make us smile.

Despite his age, Ringo is full of life and loves nothing more than spending time with people. He wants to be friends with everyone and everything, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He’s a big fan of other dogs too, though he can get quite excited when meeting them and is always eager to say hello.

Ringo is currently on a weight loss journey and has already lost 5kg—he’s doing brilliantly but still has a bit more to go to reach a healthier weight. He’ll need an owner who can keep him on track and support his continued progress.

He’s strong on the lead and does pull, so he’ll need someone confident and steady to handle him on walks. That said, he’s incredibly rewarding to be around, and his love for toys and youthful spirit make him a joy to have by your side.

Ringo may be in his golden years, but he’s truly young at heart and ready to share his love with a family who can offer him the care, companionship, and continued support he deserves.…read more

Buddy is a 4 year old Lurcher.
Buddy has now been in a foster home for a few weeks.  His foster parents report “Buddy is an affectionate loving Lurcher and puts people at ease with his playful nature. Whether he’s lounging in a sunny spot or trotting alongside his favourite humans on a walk, he brings warmth and joy wherever he goes. Loving cuddles, soft blankets and playing with his toys in the garden, he’ll become part of the family very quickly.”

When Buddy first came in to us, he was very nervous and distrusting of humans. Over time, Buddy has become a very friendly and playful boy. He very much enjoys his one-to-one time and is learning how to show affection in his own special way!

He loves nothing more than a speedy sprint around our field and will happily play fetch with a football or tennis ball until he is tired out. Treats are also a favourite of his.

Buddy is good and attentive when out on a walk and walks nicely on a lead. Owing to his lack of socialisation when younger, he can be a bit vocal when he sees other dogs out on a walk, but with further input and more socialisation this can be addressed.

As a Lurcher, Buddy has a very strong prey drive and is interested by small wildlife when out walking and small pets in the house. Therefore, Buddy would be suited to a house where he is the only dog without other pets or animals.

I’m the kind of dog who’s just happiest when I’m with you. Whether we’re heading out for a gentle stroll (I walk beautifully on the lead, by the way!) or just relaxing together at home, I’m always by your side, tail wagging and heart full.

I absolutely love human company. A bit of fuss, a few ear scratches, or just lying next to you while you go about your day — that’s my idea of bliss. I’ve got a calm, affectionate nature and I’ll never say no to some one-on-one time.

I also LOVE being out and about. Walks? Yes please! Exploring new places? Even better! I’ve got energy to burn and a playful streak too — chasing after balls and carrying around my teddies is my idea of a good time. And don’t get me started on treats… I’ve got a fantastic nose and a real talent for sniffing them out!

That’s why enrichment games with tasty rewards are a big hit with me — they keep my clever brain busy and make me one very happy dog.

I could possibly live with another friendly dog and older children (13+ years) who’ll enjoy joining me on walks, playtime, and giving out plenty of love.

I’m a gentle soul with a heart full of love and long legs made for lounging! I’m a typical lurcher — calm, well-mannered, and the king of comfort. If there’s a soft blanket or a cosy bed around, you can bet I’ve already found it.

I like to take life at my own pace — no need to rush! I’m easy-going and relaxed, and I’ve been told I walk beautifully on the lead. In fact, just the sound of you picking it up is enough to get my tail wagging and my feet ready for a nice stroll. Walks are one of my favourite parts of the day — not too fast, not too slow — just a lovely wander by your side.

I may not be the life of the party (yet!), but I’ve started to show some interest in playtime. Toys are still a bit of a mystery to me, but I’d love an understanding human who can help me figure them out. Who knows? Maybe I’ll become a toy enthusiast with a little encouragement and patience!

I absolutely love a bit of fuss and attention. Give me a good stroke and I’ll melt into you with my classic “lurcher lean” — it’s kind of my signature move. I’m friendly, affectionate, and always up for a cuddle with my favourite people.

I could possibly live with another calm dog friend and I could possibly live in a home with older children (13+), especially if they understand that I like a peaceful, gentle environment.

So if you’re looking for a calm, loving companion who will walk by your side, relax by your feet, and lean in for cuddles every chance I get — I might just be your perfect match."

Life is just SO exciting — there’s always something to chase, a toy to squeak, or a ball to zoom after. Honestly, I could play all day if you let me!

I’d absolutely love an active home with humans who enjoy adventures as much as I do. Long walks, games in the garden, or fun training sessions? Count me in! I’m still learning the ropes when it comes to manners and grown-up dog stuff, so I’ll need a patient owner who can help guide me with kindness, consistency, and lots of praise (and treats — can’t forget those!). It’s clear though that I haven’t seen much of the world. I can be a little unsure when it comes to being near roads and traffic so the team at Stray Aid have been very caring and introducing me to these experiences at a slow pace and trying to get me desensitised to these things.

But hey, it’s not all go-go-go with me. Once I’ve burned off some steam, I’m the biggest cuddle bug you’ll ever meet. I’ll happily clamber onto your lap for snuggles, ear scratches, and some one-on-one fuss time. Honestly, I’m a total softie deep down.

I might be able to live with another dog, especially one who doesn’t mind my bouncy personality and can show me the ropes. But for now, I’d do best in a home without young children — I’ve still got a bit of growing up to do, and I want to make sure I learn how to be the best version of myself!

The world can be a little overwhelming when you’re young like me. I’m still very young, and everything is so big and new — so I take things slowly, one paw at a time.

Since arriving here, I’ve been a quiet, gentle soul. I don’t really know what this “lead” thing is all about yet, and I get a bit confused when someone puts one on me — but the good news is, I love cuddles. That’s my happy place. Curling up in your arms, leaning into you for comfort, and soaking up a belly rub or two? That’s where I feel safe. That’s where I come alive.

The lovely people here say I’m starting to come out of my shell. I’ve even begun to show a playful side! When I’m outside in the play pen, something clicks — I run, I chase, and for a moment, the world isn’t so scary. It’s joyful. And I think, with the right person, I could feel that way all the time.

I’m looking for a calm, patient home where someone will understand that I need time and love to build my confidence. If you go slow with me and show me the world can be kind, I promise to give you all the love in my little body in return.

I might be able to live with another friendly dog, and possibly older children (13+) who understand I need gentleness and space while I grow braver.

Ariel is an active youngster who loves her walks in the countryside and loves to play and bounce around – she adores being around people, Ariel is very gentle so can suit living with dog savvy kids and another dog if introductions go well. She needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Ariel settles nicely and travels well in the car, and loves to go out for walks – she’s a brisk walker so will definitely help her Guardian get their steps in!  She is very affectionate and loves to cuddle with people she knows, yet she is still nervous of new people and situations, so will need a few visits to get to know her new family.

Ariel still needs some work with her recall as when off lead she gets so focused on what she is doing, she becomes ‘deaf’ to being called, yet when she does finally hear us, she becomes super excited and apologetic as if saying ‘ohh, were you calling me?!’  so off-lead training is and will be a must for her, as although people oriented, she is easily distracted.  She loves to play with other dogs, often inviting play with a bow and cheeky bouncing.

In summary, Ariel is a really delightful, good all round dog, who, with just a little bit of training, will absolutely blossom with a new loving family.

Background
All of our dogs have lived their whole lives in family groups in an open space, kennel free environment and it is therefore a shock for them to leave all that they know. For this reason, we require Ariel’s new family to either have an existing resident dog or work from home so she has company through out the day."

Eric adores people and simply craves cuddles and affection.  He has a timid nature, so can be uncertain on walks, needing some help with confidence building as he often seeks reassurance, yet he loves his walks in the countryside with his brother Ernie who he relies on for confidence – with further patient guidance and understanding from his new family, he will easily blossom into the vibrant, gregarious spirit he’s meant to be!

This kind and incredibly joyful little boy brims with affection and loyalty, he walks nicely on the lead, is great meeting people and dogs out on his walks, and with his love of people he has great recall, although with his timid nature, he can be easily startled, so off-lead walks should be limited to very safe, quiet places, close to home, that he has already got to know very well over a period of time.

Eric is a sweet, gentle soul, whose heart is full of love, so can suit living with dog savvy kids.  He needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Eric becomes much more confident when he is with another dog, as on his own he finds it difficult to cope outside of his safe surroundings, so a home with another dog is a must for Eric, either his new family will have an existing resident dog, or they adopt Eric together with his brother.

In summary, Eric is a really adorable, good natured dog, who, with just a little bit of nurturing, will absolutely flourish with a new loving family.

Born 2012-2013 they are both currently 11 years old, and although incredibly fit and healthy (on walks people guess their age as 3-4 years), finding a home for two dogs of this age together is an impossible dream, so they are available for both adoption or fostering under our Forever Foster Initiative, where we pay all of their food and medical bills; all the family have to do is provide a loving forever home, and cherish them and cuddle them for us!

They are both cuddle monsters; Kaya is full on ‘cuddle me’, whereas Maggie is a bit more reserved, and will give a subtle paw tap to ask for a tummy rub.  They love to have an occasional game of chase or spar fight, and are very good natured whilst playing. They both love their walks out and about, they walk nicely on a lead and are very social with strangers, admired by all who meet them out on their walks, and they particularly adore treat time!  Inside the home, they settle nicely, are fully house-trained and enjoy snoozing on a comfy sofa or in a plush basket.

These adorable girls are very social and polite, yet could do with some off-lead training before being allowed to run free – we totally believe in force-free training and love Tamar Geller‘s Loved Dog Method of teaching so highly recommend her books and podcasts for training.

Background
Maggie and Kaya were both originally found separately as abandoned youngsters in Bulgaria, yet were adopted into the same home in 2013 where they had lived together ever since.  Through no fault of their own, their family circumstances suddenly changed and so were returned to our sanctuary in West Wales under our Full Rescue Back Up For Life scheme."

I am a very loving dog, with the people I trust. I arrived at the New Romney rescue many years ago from a Welsh pound, no one knows my early previous history, but from my behaviour and the marks on my body, my friends at Last chance know I wasn't treated very nicely. Sometimes I can get anxious and see hands as a threat, I also struggle being out of my routine. One staff member says she is blessed to have my trust, I snuggle up for a fuss, offer her cuddles, demand a tummy tickle (poking my feet in her face) and enjoy her company on walks and in my kennel, but I admit, I do get jealous if anyone else is around us - even when I like the other people! I do get nervous around new people and situations, which sometimes means I can be a bit snappy. I am told I'm handsome and also super fit for my age, I can jump onto the picnic tables in our grounds in just one leap. I will run around the grounds chasing the wild rabbits and squirrels, but birds are my real nemesis, if only I could climb trees!!! I also love sunbathing on the grass and playing catch with my big ball, but I prefer the right company over treats and games and don't like to be left on my own. I am definitely not keen on walks in the rain or the cold! Due to my past experiences (and from the information my friends at Last Chance have gathered on my previous adoptions), I'm told I need a very special and experienced, single, adult only home, with no other animals, I may prefer a female human. Once I form a strong bond with you and feel safe, I will become your best friend, but this also means I will not want to share you, I have waited so long for you I want you all to myself!! I need a quiet home, with a secure garden, very rare visitors and definitely no children visiting! It would be best if you have a very structured routine that I could fit in to. I will need multiple visits from any potential adopter, so we can get used to each other. If you think I could be your best friend please speak to the staff at New Romney Tel: 01797 366620, or pop in to the centre during our opening times: Wed-Sun 11am-3pm. I have been at New Romney for a very long time, please consider me. Love Tito x"

She was struggling to walk and after further investigation it was discovered, she unfortunately has luxating patella in both her knees. Due to Kimi being energetic she jumps around in her kennel, bouncing off the walls, making the recovery post-surgery not possible, so she is kept comfortable with medication and is doing well on it. Since finding her love for walks and balls she has managed to shed the weight but is still in need of shedding those last few kilos. Kimi is absolutely obsessed with her toys and mainly balls. You will always find her with a ball in her mouth, whether she is out on a walk or laying in her bed she will have a toy. She treats it as a comfort blanket and wherever she goes, a toy will go with her. Kimi is great with the people she knows however it can take time to build up trust with her. Kimi does enjoy a fuss and some attention but only on her terms and only for a short period. Kimi is happiest being near and with you rather than on you like a lap dog. Kimi likes her own space, but likes to know you are around, so would prefer to sit in her bed surrounded by her toys with you in her eyesight so she knows she is not alone. One of Kimi’s rare features which we all love, if she allows you to sneak a glance is her ‘pig skin pads on her paws. Kimi is looking for an experienced adult only home with no other pets. Kimi needs an owner who will give her the time and patience she will need to earn your trust and to settle in to a home environment."

Once Jake trusts you and knows you he is a very affectionate boy and loves a cuddle on the sofa. He is very good with other dogs socially but has to be only dog at home due to resource guarding.

Dancer loves to be around you and will follow you everywhere so will need a home where he won’t be left alone for too long.

(He especially loves cheese) Dancer is an active boy who loves his long walks and exploring new places so will need an active owner and a garden of his own to run around and play freely off lead in. Dancer can get protective of his owner when on lead and can nip if anyone approaches him, because of this you will have to keep a distance from others and their dogs and walk in less populated areas. Dancer loves to play ball with you and when alone he loves to play with soft crinkly toys, you will often see him chucking them around in the air and tossing them side to side. Dancer is looking for an adult only home in a rural setting as he is noise phobic so would like a quiet home. He must be the only pet in the home.

Tetley is a striking Lurcher x Husky with soulful eyes and a heart that’s just waiting to trust again. Life hasn’t always been kind to him, and because of that, he’s a little wary of the world – but with the right person, he has the potential to truly blossom. He’s looking for a quiet, adult-only home where he can take life at his own pace. Tetley thrives in calm surroundings and will need a home away from the hustle and bustle, where peaceful walks and safe places to explore are part of his daily routine. He’d love access to secure paddocks, where he can stretch his legs and enjoy some safe off-lead time in a stress-free environment.
While we don’t have much history of Tetley’s behaviour around other dogs, we do know he prefers to keep his distance and may bark when he sees them, so a home where he can enjoy space from other animals would be ideal. No cats for Tetley either, as he’s got a strong prey drive and would find feline friends a little too interesting.

Tetley is incredibly playful and has a real soft spot for toys—especially tennis balls! He loves bringing them to you and placing them carefully in your lap, hoping you’ll join in on the fun. It’s one of the ways he bonds, and it’s a joy to see. He’s also a big fan of food-based enrichment, like snuffle mats and puzzle feeders. Not only do they keep his clever mind busy, but scent work helps him feel more confident and comfortable in his surroundings. He can be a little protective over his favourite food items, which is understandable given his past. It’s more of a reflection of how precious those things feel to him, and with time, trust, and understanding, this can be gently supported. Though shy at first, Tetley does enjoy a bit of fuss—on his own terms. When he’s in the mood, he’ll come over for some affection or a good bum scratch, showing you glimpses of the loving boy he’s becoming. Tetley doesn’t like being left alone, so any time spent away from him will need to be introduced slowly and gradually. He’ll need a family who is around most of the time to help him feel secure as he settles in.

Tetley may need a little extra time, but he’s worth every moment. With patience, kindness, and a quiet home full of love, he will be a wonderful companion for someone who sees the beauty in a sensitive soul. Could you be the person to give Tetley the second chance he deserves?

Mimi is a lovable lady with a tail that never stops wagging and a heart full of affection! She adores being close to her humans – her favourite place is snuggled up in bed with you, soaking up love and giving kisses (she might even aim for your mouth!).

Mimi can be quite scared of strangers and likes to keep her distance, so her dream match is an adult-only home that can give her the gentle handling she needs. In return, she’ll be your most loyal little shadow and biggest fan.
On walks, she can find the world overwhelming, which is why she prefers quiet, peaceful strolls where she can sniff, explore, and relax…..instead of taking charge of the local neighbourhood watch in crowded spots!

Mimi isn’t keen on sharing her humans with other pets (she has a lot to say about dogs and cats!), so she’s looking for a home where she can be the only four-legged family member. She would love a secure garden where she can stretch out, sunbathe, and enjoy some safe outdoor time – all while keeping a close eye on any pigeons that dare to share her space!

Most of all, little Mimi craves your company. Being left alone is frightening for her, so she needs someone who can provide plenty of time, reassurance, and stability. In return, she’ll shower you every day with unwavering affection and devotion, plus you’ll have a permanently warm lap!

If you can offer Mimi the quiet, loving home she longs for, she will give you her whole heart — and more.

Oz is a fun-loving, clever dog with a heart full of love and a zest for life. What he wants most is to find his very own forever family, because as Oz would say, there’s no place like home.

Bright and quick to learn, Oz has already completed an IMDT training course, charming everyone along the way with his sweet nature. He’s a little wizard when it comes to picking up new skills, and he thrives on mental stimulation. He would love to continue developing his abilities, especially through puzzle games and fun training sessions with his future family.

Oz has plenty of energy and would do best in an active home with access to a spacious garden. He enjoys his walks and playtime – fetch is a particular favourite – but he feels most comfortable in quieter areas, away from busy or overwhelming environments.

With his playful personality and enthusiasm for life, Oz is sure to bring joy and laughter to his new home. His greetings may be a bit exuberant at first, but it’s all part of his excitement to be with people. Once he settles in, he becomes incredibly affectionate and loyal, proving he’s got both brains and heart in abundance. (And while you don’t need to click your heels three times to make him appear, he’ll certainly be right by your side once he feels at home.)

Oz prefers the company of adults or older families without other pets, as he likes to be the centre of attention and can find the presence of other animals a bit too much. He also isn’t comfortable being left alone for long periods – he much prefers being near his humans, soaking up all the love he can get.

If you’re looking for a smart, affectionate, and lively companion who’s ready to bring energy, fun, and a whole lot of heart into your life, Oz could be the perfect match. You won’t need to follow the yellow brick road to find him, he is ready and waiting to meet you!

Please see below a link to see Oz playing with water in our sensory garden.

She came into the centre as an underweight stray, and it was clear she’d recently had a litter of puppies.

After lots of TLC from the staff here at the center, and our vets, she is feeling much better and is now ready to find a home with a wonderful family.

Peggy is a lovely, young, bouncy Bully, who has learnt some basic obedience since being here with us, although she'll need further training, specifically around human socialisation and lead walking.

Peggy will need to be the only pet in the home but would appreciate having dog walking companions. She can live with older teenagers (16+), so long as they're comfortable with a bouncy bully.

She absolutely loves toys and playing with the staff her at the centre. She does “swapsies” with toys well but again could do with some extra training around learning the basics like drop! Peggy loves her food and enjoys getting stuck into a variety of puzzle feeders and chews.

Peggy would be best suited to a home with a family who are around during the day to help settle her in, and build up any time left slowly at her pace.

He may only be 5kg in size but what he lacks in size he certainly makes up for in personality!

Bill is a very typical toy breed, he loves fuss, attention, playing and has a nice mix of being happy to go for a shorter walk and a snooze as well as being up for an adventure!

Although initially a little shy, it doesn't take too long (and some tasty treats) before Bill is willing to be your new best bud. He would like the humans in his home to be over the age of 12 and would prefer to have them around for most of the day. Coming to us as a stray, we are unsure if Bill has ever lived in a home before so time left will ideally need to be built up as well as his new owners considering general settling in and housetraining.

Once Bill knows you, he loves being on your lap for a nice fuss and neck scratches. He also enjoys playing with toys and will even sometimes bring them back to you! It would seem that Bill has not received any basic training yet so new owners may wish to consider training classes.

Generally, Bill can walk nicely on his lead but we would guess that he has not had much experience here. He can be a little worried when on busy roads and can be vocal towards some dogs; this will require some further training once home and settled. He would benefit from further dog socialisation and ideally have the opportunity to have some regular, friendly walking buddies.

As some of you may have seen this poor little poppet came to us in quite the state. She was severely underweight, covered in matts and an untreated parasite left her with terrible open sores, infections and scarring. Team teckels have worked their socks off and after weeks of medications, baths, creams, lotions and potions this beautiful girl is well on the mend and ready to go home. The best thing about Polly? After all the poking and prodding we've had to do, she has not once stopped wagging her tail.

Polly is clever, snuggly, super cheeky and always makes us smile. She loves her food, playing with toys and will happily hop onto your lap for a fuss. Polly has the potential to share her home with other dogs, dog savvy, calm cats and children over the age of 12.

Coming to us as a stray we unfortunately do not have any prior information as to whether Polly has lived inside before. We would encourage new adopters to be prepared for the settling in requirements for a pooch who may never have lived indoors. Polly will need some assistance with house training, general house manners, and building up time left alone. As mentioned she is a very foody lady and came to us very underweight so might be inclined to pinch food if it is not safely stashed away from tiny Polly paws.

Polly would like her new owners to be around for good portions of the day. She generally does enjoy human company but we have also notice her display some behaviours that can be linked to the beginnings of separation anxiety. It is therefore crucial that new owners are around regularly and are able to build up any time that Polly is left slowly and at a pace she is comfortable with.

New owners will also need to be prepared to amend Polly's exercise as she continues to get healthier/ stronger. At the moment, Polly will need to be exercised in a manner that allows her to continue to heal and gain the rest of the weight she needs. However, Polly is also going to be a very clever and very active lady who will need considerably more exercise in the future than she does now.

Finally in true 'doodle' style Polly will need regular grooming including full clips as well as daily brushing. We encourage new adopters to consider the time and cost of a 'doodle' coat, especially as Polly's coat may take time to recover.

Finding joy in the simple things, Moose loves playing with his toys just as much as snuggling with his handlers. Being a foodie, Moose can make friends well despite initially being shy with new people. Gaining Moose’s love and trust feels incredibly rewarding.

Moose is doing well with his lead work and picked up clicker training quickly. Even though he becomes distracted on walks, he is able to disengage and focus back on his handlers. Continued work on loose lead walking will benefit Moose, but it should be an enjoyable process as he is eager to please and loves his treats.

Due to arriving as a stray, his history is unknown. He will need a patient, gentle approach to basic training and toilet training, however, we believe he will respond well to this training, especially where treats are involved. Family members will need to be 16+ and the home will need to be pet-free.

After a difficult start in life, we look forward to seeing Moose flourish with a family who can supply him with endless love in return for lots of laughs and cuddles.

Handler Tom says, “Moose has always made me laugh when he gets excited in the paddocks and his back legs overtake his front legs”.

Despite his age, he loves playing with toys and enjoys sniffing and exploring on his walks.

Brisco is an anxious boy, but seeing him grow in confidence and gain his handlers’ trust has been very rewarding as he has learned to do swapsies with his favourite toys and even snuggles up for cuddles.

Sadly, Brisco’s family could no longer care for him, but he has lived in a home environment and should only need a refresher on basic training and toilet training while he settles in. Brisco would need to be the only pet in the home while he enjoys his golden years. A quiet household with all members being 18+ would suit Brisco’s retirement plan of sofa snoozes, toys, and treats.

Although introductions may take time to build Brisco’s trust, the reward will be worthwhile as you will get to know his sweet, sometimes silly personality.

Handler Annie says, “Initially, Brisco can be worried around his toys, but the first time he swapped his favourite ball for a treat was such a special moment where I felt like he trusted me”.

She came into the center with Missy but they have since been separated as they were finding sharing their space difficult and after different homes.

Lulu may be 14 years old, but she’s still full of life and energy! She has such a playful character and loves to chase around after toys (her favourites are tennis balls). She is looking for a fairly active family who can match her enthusiasm and provide her with lots of fun and stimulation.

She is strong on the lead and enjoys her walks, so a family with experience handling energetic dogs will be a great fit for her. Lulu can struggle to focus while out on walks and can get overwhelmed, so she is currently having some training to help her with this.

Although she does need some exercise and playtime, she will also appreciate quiet moments and loves a snuggle on a sofa, so would love a family who are around during the day to keep her company.

Lulu can get stressed in new environments and needs a calm and consistent home where she can enjoy her retirement and feel comfortable. A home with a secure garden to play in and a sofa to cuddle up on would be ideal! Lulu would prefer not to share her home with young children, older teenagers (16+) with introductions done at the center would be best.

Lulu has struggled with being in kennels so has been spending time in foster and getting on well, though her foster family are unable to keep her. We would love her to find her forever home soon so she doesn't have to spend anymore time in kennels.

While she enjoys human companionship, she’s not keen on other dogs or animals, so a pet-free home would be best.

Pumba is such a sweet boy who loves nothing more than snuggles, his bed and humans! Perfect Pumba has come to us through no fault of his own so unfortunately we have very limited information about his background. He has managed to settle in well here and brings a perfect mix of wanting to go for long wanders with his handlers but will equally happily have as many sofa snuggles he can get! - We're not sure which one he loves more!

Pumba appears to be a somewhat laid back chap who just seems to take the world in his stride. He does lack some confidence on occasions but generally is up for most adventures big or small. We are unsure as to how much training he has received and can be a little strong on the lead at times but is working on this and making some lovely improvements. Being a sighthound we would still encourage new owners to consider the handling he may require when out and about and be confident enough to do so.

As mentioned, we do not have much history for Pumba, including whether he has lived in a home or not,  so we encourage new owners to consider the potential hurdles of settling a new dog in - housetraining, building up time left, sleeping through the night etc. Pumba will need his new family to be around for good portions of the day to help assist with this and make the transition from kennels to home as smooth as possible. Pumba would also like to be the only pet in his new home.

When Pumba is not snoozing away on his comfy bed, he does love a good play session, and being a typical lurcher, this does include a quick zoomie or two! He would therefore also need his own, enclosed garden to have a nice play in and of course, lots of toys too! Pumba also enjoys a good training session and is a clever and food motivated boy!

Since joining us at the centre we have seen this timed, shy girlie grow into a complete snuggle monster who adores spending time with the people she knows.

Leia is really quite a worried lady who can find the big wide world quite scary. We are unsure as to how much lead training/ walks she has had in her past but the concept of going for a walk really does prove a struggle for her currently. During her stay here she has really got the hang of going to our paddocks for a run around and our home rooms for snuggles but still finds going for a walk quite challenging. Leia will need her new home to have an enclosed garden in which she can play and temporarily use as her exercise area. Her new home will need to be close to quiet walks with easy access to get there so when she is ready to venture outside, she will not be too overwhelmed. Once settled and more confident on walks we're sure Leia would enjoy expanding her walking options but for now it's all just a little too much for her. Her new owners will need to be super patient with this process and really have the time to devote to improving this. We also recommend any potential adopters consider how life will look going from a dog who requires minimal walking to one who will need more exercise as she settles.

Being a more reserved dog, Leia would like to live in a calm, only pet, adult only home with a consistent routine. She would prefer her new owners to be around for most of the day but we do feel she has potential to be left for a couple of hours if built up slowly. Leia also has some basic obedience tricks like sit, paw and down and really enjoys learning new things for tasty treats - she's super clever!

One of Leia's biggest loves in life is sofa snuggles. Being typical bull breed type she is all about the fuss, neck scratches and sofa snoozes with little regards for personal space - it's our favourite thing! Although wary of new people, once she has gotten to know you, you'll have a best friend for life.

Leia really tries her best in all that she does, we think she may have had a bit of a tricky start in life, yet she still is always trying her best to please and so trusting of the people she knows.

If you are interested in giving Leia her forever home, please click the 'enquire now' button below or see our 'how to adopt' section for more information. Due to the number or enquiries we receive we are currently only able to contact successful applicants."

Despite lacking confidence, he has shown his handlers he has lots of love to give and should grow to be a loyal companion who is eager to please, especially when treats are involved.

Coming from a home environment, Max was house-trained and could be left for a couple of hours. Some refresher training and time left being gradually built up should enable Max to settle into home life once again.

Due to some unfortunate interactions with dogs that weren't his fault, Max is wary of other dogs and tends to ignore them/would rather avoid them. A pet-free home with a fully enclosed garden and quiet areas for walks would help Max to feel safe and grow in confidence.

He will benefit from continued lead work as he can be strong at times, although his training at the centre is going well. His foodie personality and desire to please should make training a rewarding process.

This clever boy enjoys snuggles with his handlers, especially bum scratches, and plays with toys nicely. He is now looking for an all-adult family with breed/ guarding breed trait experience so he can enjoy a consistent, uncomplicated life. Max needs help building his stamina whilst exercising, we feel he'd be happy in a home with a large sized garden, where he can explore around, and would more than likely be happy with the odd 30 minute walk, just to sniff along, at his own pace!

Handler Cicely says, “Despite an initial lack of confidence, it is so lovely to now see Max's waggy-tailed greetings as he bounds over to say hello. He gives the best cuddles, and now he trusts me, will snuggle up next to me in the paddock while we watch the world go by”.

Arthur came into the center along with his siblings, after his owner had an accidental litter and they were unable to care for them.  He hasn't had the easiest start in life, but this cheeky chap is ready for his own family.

He is looking for patient owners who will guide him with positive reinforcement training and socialisation. We strongly recommend puppy classes to help him continue to build his confidence and grow into a loving, well-rounded companion.

Whilst we don’t know exactly how big Arthur’s parents were, due to his breed we expect him to grow into a large, strong dog. It is easy to fall for Arthur’s wrinkly face, but it is important adopters carefully consider the long-term costs and commitment to his breed.

To help Arthur transition into his new home, he will need plenty of time with new owners at home for house training and settling in. Slowly increasing alone time will help him feel more comfortable as he adjusts.

Arthur would prefer quieter walking areas initially, where we can continue to build his confidence and experience the world.

Arthur can live with older children 16+, and adopters should keep in mind that his puppy teeth may be painful during the teething stage. Patience and training will help him through this stage.

He already knows lots of basic commands such as sit, down, paw and is eager to learn more with his family.

Arthur hasn't had many social interactions and lacks confidence; therefore will need to be the only pet in the home.

He does have walking buddies and play friends here at the center, and staff have been working with him to help build his confidence around other dogs. With slow, positive introductions, he has the potential to form positive relationships and have walking buddies and playmates with his new owners.

Ron arrived at the center along with his siblings as part of an accidental litter, and his owners were unable to care for them.

He may have had a tough start, but he’s not letting that hold him back.

Ron is looking for a patient, caring home where he can continue to learn and grow through positive reinforcement training and socialisation. Ron is eager to learn, and puppy classes are a great way for him to grow and build his confidence.

He is an intelligent dog and already knows lots of basic commands such as sit, down, paw and is eager to learn more.

Ron is a Shar Pei-Rottweiler mix with lots of growing ahead. Whilst we don’t know how big he will get, we do expect him to be a large boy. He may be adorable now, but he will need a committed home ready for the care and cost associated with this breed.

Whilst Ron settles into his new home, new owners will need to be around most of the day to help with house training. Once settled in, building up time left alone will need to be done gradually at his own pace.

Ron can find meeting new people and some dogs a little overwhelming at times, so he will need a patient home with sensible children 16+. He would prefer to be the only pet in the home; however, he would benefit from continued socialisation with calm, confident dogs to help build his confidence.

Ron loves going for walks but would benefit from quieter walking areas where he can continue his training to walk nicely on a lead and become more comfortable around other dogs.

Our vets have estimated him to be around 3 years old.

Since settling in and finding his paws, we are starting to see a very sweet, gentle chap who just wants to be close to his humans.

Coming to us as a stray, we do not have any history on Lennie's world before Teckels. He does seem to have some dog social skills and is particularly fond of other sighthounds, but has been able to walk with other medium - to large-sized breeds here too.

Lennie has the potential to share his home with another medium/ large dog, but can be quite vocal with his play, so would be best suited to sharing his home with a canine companion who is used to this play style.

For a bigger chap, Lennie walks nicely on his lead but doesn't seem to have received any other training. We would encourage new owners to consider taking him to treat-based training classes to not only up his skills but also help with his confidence.

Lennie loves his walks and exploring the local areas, he will also need a family who are happy and confident to walk a bigger dog.

Being a more worried boy, Lennie would prefer his family members to be 14+ and will need his new family to be around all day initially, with time left alone built up nicely and slowly.

Lennie struggled with settling when he first arrived at the centre. This has subsided over time, but we would like owners to be prepared for any potential separation anxiety behaviours that may occur during his settling-in period.

There is potential that he may be able to be left for short periods once confident in the 'being left' routine.

Lennie is a gentle giant. He adores being fussed over once he knows you, and will cuddle on the sofa all day with the staff here.

"cmfr9aubj004rpkl7xvcoq1fo","2afda9c","Barney","Poodle","1 year","Male","1 - 3 years","Gloucester","Gloucestershire","South West","Teckels","https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BarneyS2-768x1024.jpg","https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/animals/barney/","2025-09-14T23:00:00.000Z","2025-09-19T19:52:34.301Z","We reintroduce to you the very handsome Barney! Barney has recently found his way back into our care after his previous match didn't quite work out. Since being returned to us Barney and his handlers have been working super hard on some extra skills to make sure Barney has all the tools he needs to be a wonderful pet in his new home. Poor Barney really has been passed from pillar to post in his short life - he had more than one home before coming to us! It really is crucial that this next home is Barney's 'forever' so we encourage any potential adopter to really consider the information below before applying. Barney has so much to offer but we really need new owners to see past all those beautiful curls and teddy bear face and be able to offer the stability Barney so desperately wants.

Firstly, Barney might be one of the cleverest pooches we know! There is nothing we haven't been able to teach this dog so far. He knows sit, paw, down, stay and we have invested lots of time in helping him feel braver about all the things he used to find terrifying - this has been really quite a challenge for him but we are so impressed with the progression he has made.

Although initially a 'hands off' kinda boy, as soon as you've won his trust Barney is a super snuggler! We wouldn't go as far as a 'lap dog' but neck scratches and then flopping down on your feet to snooze is a firm favourite for Barn. Knowing that Barney can find physical touch quite scary; it's a really heart-warming moment when he asks the people he knows for fuss and who are we to say no!

Barney's best loves in life are of course, food and toys. Barney will try his best to learn anything you wish to teach him as long as there is food involved - he is very clever but we do get the suspicion he is ruled by his tummy! And then there are toys. He's not fussy, any toy and any play is the best in Barneys mind and we really see him perk up when the toy box is present. Fetch, find it, tug -o- war; you name it he'll play it! For a worried boy, it's so lovely to see him so happy to play.

As mentioned Barney can be a bit or a worrier. Due to this he is looking for a consistent home life but one that can still offer a somewhat active life style. Barney thrives of routine and consistency really helps him feel more confident because it's easier for him to work out what is expected of him. Equally, Barney is still a mix of two very clever and energetic breeds so as much as we would like his home life to be steady; he would also need a home where he can go for longer walks with lots to sniff. He would love to carry on with his training (plus anything new!) to help use up his energy constructively and will need a secure garden big enough for him to play in off lead.

It would also seem that Barney has missed out on some doggy social skills too. He does try is best to make friends but can be a little stand off-ish when he meets unknown dogs. Barney has managed to make some doggy walking friends here and would benefit from having some calm, confident walking friends once settled but would not like to share his home with any other pets.

Due to Barney finding some elements of life worrying, he would need all the humans in his new home to be over the age of 18. Experience of owning a 'doodle' type would be beneficial but our rehoming team will also be on hand to offer lots of advise and support for Barney both pre and post adoption.

What Barney needs more than anything is someone who will stick with him through the trickier bits as well as all the wonderful ones. Barney's biggest struggle is trust and we can completely understand why he feels this way. Lots of people have entered his life and disappeared and we can't explain to him that one day someone magic will come along for him and stay.

If you feel Barney is the boy for you, please see the 'how to adopt' section of the website or alternatively, please click the 'Enquire now' button below.

Coming to us as a stray we unfortunately do not have much information about this little chap, including whether he has lived in a home before. We would ask new adopters to make sure they have plenty of time to help him settle in and teach him all the things he needs to learn about being a good boy at home.

Ben does have a shy side initially but after a bit of time, space and plenty of treats - he soon becomes your new best friend! He would like all the humans in his new home to be over the age of 12 and would prefer to live in a calmer household with people around for good portions of the day. We do feel he has potential to be left alone for a couple of hours but this may need building up slowly. He will also need a secure garden to play in.

Ben would like to be the only pet in his new home - it would seem that he has missed out on some social skills and can find meeting new dogs a little worrying. For the most part, he walks very nicely on his lead but can be on the 'woofy' side when other dogs come too close. He has been doing some work here and has managed to  make some canine pals but would benefit from training in the future.

Ben absolutely loves a cuddle when he knows you. He will happily sit on your lap or snuggle down next to you on the sofa. He also loves his food and has already learnt to sit in the short time he has been here. Ben also enjoys playing with his toys, he loves fetch and will give you a good game of tug - o - war (we do often left him win of course, he's only 4.5 kg!).

Finally, Ben also does enjoy a brush. Being a long haired chap, Ben will need regular grooming - trims, baths and brushing. Fortunately he does quite like this but we do encourage any potential adopters to consider the time and cost this may require.

Basic Information
Age: 2 years 6 months
Sex: Male (Neutered)
Good with dogs? Yes – good with other dogs; best with calm, steady companions
Good with cats? Not tested
Good with children? Adult-only home
Time able to be left alone: Short periods only once fully settled
Health & Medical Needs

Health conditions: Chiari-like malformation–associated pain; has had patellar luxation surgery 
On medication? Yes – prescribed pregabalin and Galliprant daily for pain management by the neurologist- Reduced adoption fee applies

Behaviour & Personality

Behaviour traits: Loving, people-focused, playful; sensitive to handling at times; historic resource guarding linked to pain, improving with pain relief
Activity level: Moderate – enjoys walks, sniffing games and enrichment
Training required: Ongoing confidence building and positive reinforcement; calm management around food/resting spaces; gentle handling for harness/collar

About Ralph

Ralph is a striking young Ruby Cavalier with a huge heart and a lot of potential. At just 2.5 years old, he’s already been through quite a journey, managing pain from Chiari-like malformation and recovering from previous knee surgery. With the right medication, Ralph has started to show the loving, cuddly and playful boy he really is.

He’s very people-focused and enjoys being close to his humans, whether that’s on a walk, playing enrichment games, or simply snoozing nearby. Ralph travels well in the car, loves his walks, and is always up for a bit of fun. 

Ralph still has moments of guarding food, socks or toys, but this has improved hugely. He will always take advantage of pinching a dropped sock or some random item, so his adopters must be one step ahead. He will need adopters who can continue with calm, positive reinforcement training and who understand the importance of giving him space when he needs it.

Ralph would suit a calm, adult-only home where he can thrive with structure and gentle handling. He gets on well with other dogs but would be happiest alongside a calm and steady companion rather than a very anxious or boisterous one.

In the right home, Ralph will reward his family with loyalty, affection, and a cheeky, playful personality. He is a very special boy who, with patience and understanding, will make a truly wonderful companion.

Adoption Criteria

Type of home required: Calm, adult-only home experienced with behaviour needs. Adopters must be willing to follow his pain-management plan, maintain routine, use gentle handling, and continue reward-based training. A steady canine companion could suit him well.

Important Notes
Adopters must have insurance or financial means to cover future medical costs.
Home check and meet & greet required within 7-10 days of applying.

MY HISTORY

Taz has been a well loved dog and has been in one home since he was a puppy. Due to unforseen circumstances, he is looking for a new home through SSR. Taz is currently residing with his owner still whilst on our waiting list to come in. We would welcome applications from those who may wish to foster him or “foster with a view to adopt”.

ABOUT TAZ

Hi, I’m Taz!

I’m a typical bouncy, exciteable Staffie who loves to meet new people!

I love my food and treats, I have been known to dip into the bin I love food so much! I am very gentle in taking treats though and I know the sit command and will wait patiently.

I have not lived with children but I have had some experience with visiting children. Because I can be jumpy and mouthy, I could possibly live with children aged 12+ if those children are used to being around dogs.

I am comfortable being left for up to 4 hours in my current home.

I travel well in the car, I just get a little excited in anticipation of where we are going!

My favourite toy is my ball.

Please reach out to my rescue if you can offer me a home!

HEALTH

I will have a health check when I arrive. No obvious concerns to report.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I would prefer not to socialise or say hello to other dogs.

I am muzzle trained out on walks.

MY IDEAL HOME

I would love a dog experienced home committed to providing me with sufficient mental draining and physical expercise. I am a clever boy who loves to learn!

I’m happiest when I’m with my people and I am used to a bust household with lots going on.

I currently live with children.

I would prefer a home where someone is around a lot of the time, but I can be left for short, reasonable periods of time.

Please reach out if you can offer me a foster home or a foster with a view to adopt home if you would like a short trial period with me!

MY HEALTH

I do have some allergies but nothing that cannot be easily be managed.

I am due a health review when I am in rescue.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I would prefer not to say hello to other dogs and keep walking past. I quite nicely on lead and I don’t have any recall.

MY IDEAL FAMILY

I would love a bull breed experienced family where someone is around most of the time for me.

I Am… 4 ½ Years Old

I Am… Staffie Cross

I Am… Approximately 25kg

Can I be rehomed with other dogs… No

Can I be rehomed with cats… No

Can I be rehomed with children… Over 12 years. I like all children but I can be a bit over exuberant for younger chidren.

I am looking for… A foster home

MY HISTORY

Rubble has already been in 3 homes in his life so far, due to no fault of his own. His first home rehomed him because they were due to have a baby and wanted to put him down as he was no longer wanted! His next home was a much more loving home, but sadly due to a divorce, they are no longer able to keep him. Rubble in now in a temporary third home who stepped in to help him out in his time of need.

Rubble is currently living out of our area and is looking for a home to come forward to foster him, or we would welcome applications who may be able to foster with a view to adopt. We are unable to facilitate meet and greets due to the distance until he finds a local placement with us.

ABOUT RUBBLE

Hi, I’m Rubble (got my name from TV Paw Patrol series).

I’m a typical bouncy and boisterous Staffie! I am full of energy and always happy!

I love to be around people and can be quite lively at first when visitors first come to the house, but I do settle down after a short period of time.

I enjoy lots of strokes and cuddles chilling out with/on my caregivers laps on the sofa, particularly in the evening after my walks.

I love to play ball in the garden!

I can do most of the basic commands – Sit, Lay down, Paw, No, Wait, Stay – but I am still learning about always coming when called – although I am getting better at it. I’m also learning to respond to the command “leave” and “fetch” when playing with a ball, but haven’t quite got the hang of it consistently.

I love my walks and like to say hello to as many people as possible. I particularly enjoy running around in a secure dog park where I can burn off all my energy!

I can be left for short, reasonable periods of time and I am really good travelling in the car too.

HEALTH

I am due a health check when I arrive. No obvious health concerns to address.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am not fully socialised with other dogs. Most dogs I am happy to sniff and move on, but some dogs I can be anxious around some dogs and react. I am looking for a home who can understand this and not put me in unwanted situations.

I have made a few dog friends with slow and gentle introductions.

I generally walk well on the lead unless I get overstimulated. I will pull if I see a cat, squirrel or bird!

MY IDEAL FAMILY

I would love to finally find a forever family who are committed to me for life! I have been through too many homes already. I would suit most family set ups, in particular a home who are able to give me plenty of physical exercise and mental enrichment as I am a clever boy!

Please reach out to my team if you can offer me a home!"

MY HISTORY

Rex has been a well loved dog his whole life. Sadly, due to unforeseen circumstances, he is looking for a new home through Staffie and Stray Rescue. Rex is currently still with his owner whilst he waits for his new home to come forward so that he doesn’t have to go into kennels or a temporary foster placement.

ABOUT REX

Hi, I’m Rex!

I am a really friendly and loveable boy looking for a new home. I have been so well loved and I would love to find a home who can continue to love me just as much.

I’m a very affectionate and loving boy, I am extra loving when I know that you are having a bad day or if you are sad, I will try my best to make you feel better! I form good bonds with people.

I used to live with children and I am used to having visiting children at home.

I can be a bit chatty sometimes, when I want some treats or more attention, I will demand it!

I can be left for short, reasonable periods of time and I am happy with my own company.

I am very active and playful, I love to play with balls and sticks in particular! I also enjoy tug toys and will shred up teddies in no time!

I am fine travelling in the car.

My personality in a nutshell: Loving, playful, lazy and affectionate.

I know lots of tricks and commands such as: Sit, paw, down, spin, middle.

I really enjoy my walks and I walk well on the lead generally… Unless I spot a cat!

I am an all round good boy and I would love for someone to come forward and offer me a 5* home!

HEALTH

No health concerns. I am not on any medication.

I will be due a health check with the rescue once I have found my forever home.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am quite neutral with other dogs out on walks, or perhaps just have a sniff and move on.

With dog friends that I know well, I have more of a play.

Slow and gentle dog introductions work best for me."

I am a very high energy, happy boy with a lot of love to give!

I can be very strong on lead and will need some work on this.

Please reach out to the team if you can help me.

MY HISTORY

Lulu was found as a stray and taken to kennels. She was microchipped to an owner but sadly no-one came foward to claim her.

ABOUT LULU

Hi, I’m Lulu!

I have been through a lot and I am looking for a dedicated home who can offer me a loving home and a new life!

I am a clever girl who loves to learn! I am really into food which has supported my training! Perhaps I love food a bit too much! I will steal food that is easily accessible to me!

I can be strong on the lead initially but I do get better after the inital excitement. I have really enjoyed walks out in the New Forest with my rescue team.

I already know the commands sit, paw and drop (during ball games)

I have had a home assessment with the team, and I can get very excited being back in a home! I will have some crazy zoomie moments! I really enjoy playing with toys, in particular with balls and snuffle mats/balls.

Being a working breed, I am looking for a home who can give me plenty of physical and mental stimulation. If I am not doing much, I find jobs of my own to do, but not necessarily desireable jobs, such as opening door handles or stealing things around the home!

Please reach out to my team if you can offer me a foster or forever home.

HEALTH

I am in good health. I am not on any medication.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am not recactive towards other dogs, but I can get over-excited sometimes. Some dogs may not recieve this well if they don’t match my energy.

MY IDEAL HOME

I am looking for a dog experienced and active family who can give me lots of exercise and mental draining. I would really enjoy things like scent training or agility training."

MY HISTORY

Lola was found as a stray and taken to kennels. Sadly no-one came forward for her so she is looking for a new home through SSR.

ABOUT LOLA

Hi, I’m Lola!

I have been in kennels since December and I have had no interest.

I’m a big girl with a big personality and I would love a dog experienced home, or even better, a home that is used to larger breeds.

I have been passed around a lot in my life, I have been used for breeding and I have spent a lot of my time living outside.

Please don’t worry, I am not a banned breed and I have certifications to show that I am eligible for rehoming.

I can be quite aloof in nature and I love going on walks and having a good sniff of everything. You have my full attention if you have treats though! I will sit and paw and take treats ever so gently.

I do really enjoy my toys, I am quite active for a larger dog. my absolute favourite toy is my giggle ball! I will chase it around and roll on top of it!

I travel well in the car, in fact I love being in the car!

I get super excited when you get my lead out to go out! Currently I am strong on lead but tI have been used to wearing a halti which has helped.

Although I have been in kennels a long time, I am very happy here and I get a lot of time out and stimulation.

I have had an in-home assessment where I did struggle a lot being in a home. We would be open to a home with a kennel in the garden with full access to a garden which might make my settlement a little easier where I can come and go into the house as/when I please.

Please reach out if you can offer me a foster or forever home.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am generally quite aloof around other dogs, I have been used as a dog tester with new dogs arising in the kennels.

I may react back if a dog reacts to me and I can be a bit more on edge with smaller reactive breeds.

I am muzzle trained and I accept my muzzle very easily, but I don’t necessarily need to wear it all the time.

I cannot live with other dogs due to guarding issues that have arisen when in the presence of other dogs in a home setting.

MY IDEAL HOME

I would love a home that is dog experienced and preferably large breed experienced.

A home with patience in helping me settle as it may take some time. Full support provided to you by the team at SSR!"

Hi, I’m Jade.

My team are currently getting it under contol. I am making really good progress but may require another course of steriods to help. I have been amazing in the vets and being handed has been no problem.

I was really shut down when I arrived, I spent 5 weeks in kennels with my rescue team building me up and allowing my personality to come out and shine in my own time.

Thankfully, a foster home came forward to help me! I have thrived being in a home! I have started to enjoy home comforts and engage in some play!

I walk nicely on the lead and enjoy having a good sniff of everything.

I have shown a bit of anxiety travelling in the car but I travel well once I am in.

I can be left for reasonable periods of time with no issues.

MY HISTORY

Freddie has been a well loved dog and had been with one owner since he was a puppy. Sadly due to unforeseen circumstances, he is looking for a new home. Freddie is currently residing with his current owners not local to us. We are looking for a local foster home or a family who may be open to “foster with a view to adopt” so that we can welcome Freddie into our care.

ABOUT FREDDIE

Hello, I’m Freddie the pocket rocket!

I love to meet new people, I can get very over-excited and boisterious with visitors, I cannot contain myself! Once I know people, I am a lot calmer generally around the home.

I am used to being left for short, reasonable periods of time – This may need to be built up as I settle into a new home.

I travel well in the car.

I can be a bit anxious if there is a loud motorbike passing me on a walk.

I haven’t had much experience with children, I am looking for a home with older children and preferably no young visitors as I can be anxious.

I know the commands sit and paw and I will take treats gently.

I am an affectionate boy looking for a 5* home!

Please reach out to my team if you can offer me a home.

HEALTH

I am due a health review when I arrive. No obvious health concerns. I am not on any medication.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I have had a lot of mixed experiences with other dogs. I can be reactive in the face of another dog.

I have been on walks with other dogs where I can walk politely next to them.

I can be different with different handlers so I am looking for a confident dog handler who can cope with varying levels of reactivity.

ABOUT CASPER

Hi, I’m Casper!

I’m a slightly larger breed but I am tall and skinny rather than stocky! So please don’t overlook me due to my weight!

I have not had a bad life overall but unforseen circumstances have led me to find myself in kennels. I am really struggling here and I am spending a lot of my time hiding at the back of the kennels.

I have come out of my shell with team members and shown my silly goofy side! Hotdogs seem to be the ticket for being my best friend!

I am a bit of a needy and affectionate boy.

I am a lot more relaxed outside of the kennel environment and I have enjoyed playing with toys in the paddock.

The team are still learning about me but I am desperate for a home!

MY HISTORY

Arnie has been a well loved dog since a  puppy. Sadly due to not getting on with the resident dog, he is looking for a new home. Arnie is still living with his owner and waiting for a placement with us. We would welcome applications from families who may wish to ‘foster with a view to adopt’ where we can get him straight into a foster placement. Please email us for more information on how this works.

ABOUT ARNIE

Hi, I’m Arnie.

I’m a super friendly chap who loves to meet new people!

I really enjoy treats and know the commands ‘sit’, ‘paw’ and ‘twist’

I have been used to living with children and visiting children with no issues.

I’m quite a needy boy and I love getting lots of fuss and attention, I will most likely be your shadow and follow your around the house!

I am fine being left for short, reasonable periods of time.

I would love to sleep on your bed at night if possible! But if not, I’m sure with training I would get used to a new night time routine.

I am currently being fed on a raw diet.

I travel well in the car no problems, I recently took a trip in the car for a few hours to go on my holidays!

Please get in touch if you think you might be able to offer me a foster or forever home!

HEALTH

I have no health concerns but I will have a health review at the vets in due course.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I would not like to socialise with other dogs. I may need some further training in learning to pass other dogs calmly. I am muzzle trained for walking in areas where dogs are off lead. The rescue are happy to support my future family with behaviour advice and training tips.

MY IDEAL FAMILY

I would suit a typical family home who can provide me with lots of attention and mental stimulation. Preferably a home who are bull breed experienced or experienced with reactive dogs.

Here are some key points about Jasper's personality and needs:




Cheeky and playful: Jasper loves to have fun and show everyone a good time, especially in his kennel.




Loves company: Jasper craves attention and affection from people, and he's a sweet dog who loves to cuddle and greet everyone he meets.




Needs reassurance: Jasper lacks confidence, but his time in foster care has helped him build some self-assurance. He still requires further support to boost his confidence.




Intelligent and trainable: Jasper is a smart dog who picks up on training quickly and enjoys interacting with people and his toys.




Nervous in certain situations: Jasper can become nervous around people and certain dogs on occasion, especially in stressful situations. This can lead him to reacting to other dogs by barking.
He will need on going when meeting new dogs out and about.




Good recall but needs improvement: Jasper has good basic training and his recall is generally good, but he would benefit from further training in this area.




Requires a patient owner: Jasper needs an owner who is understanding of dog body language and willing to use reward-based training to help him build confidence.




Needs regular grooming: Jasper requires regular grooming to keep his coat in good condition.


Living arrangements: Jasper requires company during the day and to be the only pet in house. He would benefit from a reasonable-sized garden for playtime and zoomies, and an owner who is willing to invest time in training and socialization. However, due to his nervous nature, Jasper is not suitable for households with children.







Overall, Jasper is a lovable and playful dog who requires a patient and understanding owner who can provide him with the care and attention he needs to thrive.




Meet and Greet with Jasper will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to suitable adoption application."

﻿

Initial struggles: Oaty had a tough time adjusting to kennel life due to a bad experience with a crate and the stress of being in a new environment.




Building trust: The staff and volunteers worked hard to build Oaty's trust, and he has learned to see the kennel as a safe space. Crating is not advisable




Wary of strangers: Oaty can be cautious around people he doesn't know, especially when it comes to personal space and touch. He is muzzle-trained for grooming and vet visits.




Affectionate with trusted individuals: Oaty is very affectionate with staff and volunteers who have taken the time to bond with him and gain his trust.




Confident around dogs: Oaty is generally confident and calm around most dogs and enjoys social walks off-site.




Cat-chasing: Oaty has a strong desire to chase cats, which is a work in progress. We would not recommend that Oaty is re-homed with cats.




Intelligent and active: Oaty is an intelligent and active dog who needs mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom.




Suitable home: Oaty would thrive in an adult-only home with no visiting children, where his owners can take the time to build a relationship and bond with him.

Here’s a comprehensive overview of Rizzo's needs and ideal home situation:

﻿

Previous Home Environment: Rizzo was surrendered to the rescue after her family realized they could not provide her with the necessary time, stimulation, and exercise. The busy home environment was overwhelming for her, prompting the need for a calmer setting.




Loyal Companion: Rizzo is a loving and loyal dog who forms strong bonds with those who earn her trust. Once she feels secure, she blossoms into a wonderful companion.




Playful Nature: She has a strong love for tennis balls and enjoys structured play, making activities like scent games very beneficial for her mental and physical stimulation.




Calming Influence: Rizzo has a calm demeanour and interacts well with other dogs, often acting as a role model and helping to teach confidence to other dogs in the rescue.




Sensory Sensitivity: Like many Border Collies, Rizzo can be sensitive to noises and unfamiliar situations (e.g., vacuums, TVs, and objects on wheels). However, with time, patience, and exposure to these elements in training, she has shown improvement.




Experience with Border Collies: Rizzo would thrive in a home with someone who has experience with her breed. Understanding her herding instinct and sensitivity is vital for her development and comfort.




Calm Home Environment: Given her background, Rizzo would do best in a calmer household, ideally without children or with only visiting children, as a busy environment can be stressful for her.




Training Focus: A commitment to reward-based training is essential for Rizzo, as it helps her build confidence, adapt to new situations, and settle into her new home successfully. She will benefit from structured training sessions and consistent reinforcement of positive behaviours.




Multiple Meet and Greets: Before adoption, Rizzo should have several meet and greets with potential adopters to build trust and ensure that she feels comfortable in her new environment.




Space for Play and Stimulation: Rizzo will need an environment that allows for plenty of exercise and mental challenges. Access to a secure garden where she can safely play and explore is ideal.




Rizzo is a loving dog with the potential for a wonderful companionship if she is placed in the right home. With her intelligence and eagerness to bond, along with a dedicated and experienced owner, Rizzo can flourish. If you are looking for a sweet and loyal companion who needs a little patience and understanding, Rizzo might be the perfect fit for you!




Meet and Greet with Rizzo will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to suitable adoption application."

His wagging tail and affectionate nature make him a joy to be around, and once he settles into his new home, you’ll have a bond for life.




Loyal Companion: He adores human company and thrives in a home where he has companionship throughout the day, as he can sometimes become destructive when left alone in his kennel.


Energy & Exercise Needs: Pete is a bundle of joy. He loves a good walk and enjoys off-lead play for about 20 minutes before happily settling down on a comfy sofa or bed to relax.


Walking & Awareness: On the lead, he walks beautifully, making strolls with him a pleasure. However, as a sighthound, he has a keen eye for small animals and will notice them long before you do, so awareness and management on walks are important.


Socialisation & Other Animals: Pete loves meeting people and always greets them with a wagging tail. He could potentially live with another dog, but slow introductions would be necessary. He could also live with dog-savvy children, but he is not suitable to live with cats or small animals.


Experience with Sighthounds: A home with sighthound experience would be ideal, but not required, as understanding his natural instincts will help him thrive.


Training Needs: His basic training is still a work in progress, so ongoing training will be beneficial to help him settle and develop good manners. He is also not consistently clean in his kennel, so this may need some work once in a home.
 

If you’re looking for an affectionate, fun-loving companion and have the time to continue his training and provide him with the exercise and care he needs, Pete could be the perfect addition.



Meet and greets will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to a suitable adoption application."

History: Amber was found as a stray. She has grown so much in confidence since being with us, however, this still needs work. She needs someone who has the time and patience to build a relationship and bond with her.




Experience with Large Breeds: Amber would suit a family who have experience with large, high-energy breeds.




Home Environment: Amber would suit a home where someone is home most of the time; she can sometimes be noisy when left. She would not be suitable to be re-homed with children, cats or other small animals.




Training and Abilities: Amber has good basic obedience and walks nicely on lead. She's an intelligent dog who enjoys scent work and has even shown promise with basic agility skills.

Experience with Malinios': Flo's adopters should have experience with Malinios' as the breed experience will help her to thrive.


Home Environment: Flo would suit an active home and someone being home most of the time. She would not be suitable to be rehomed with children (due to her age and size), cats or other small animals. There should also be no visiting children to the house.

Health Note: Flo had an injury to her front left paw when she arrived, after an x-ray, it showed that all the toes have been broken at some point in her short life and have not healed correctly. While she is currently comfortable and is taking a joint supplement, she may be prone to developing arthritis or mobility issues later in life.

He’s a strong boy with bags of energy and would love to have a garden to run around in to burn off some of that energy. He can be boisterous at times and he would enjoy living in a home where there is plenty of activities to keep him stimulated. He has lived with another dog and has been very happy to have canine company.

He doesn’t seem to get possessive over toys or his owner’s attention but he can be rather clumsy which some other dogs might find rather annoying. He can walk very well on a lead but does tend to pull quite strongly at times particularly to inspect interesting looking lampposts! He can also get very excited when he sees other dogs out and about and he will vocalise his excitement at some volume particularly when he is out walking with another doggie companion.

Baxter is a very obedient boy and knows basic commands. He’s eager to please, very responsive to training and has bags of potential for an owner with the time to train him. Baxter doesn’t like sleeping in a crate and is able to successfully head butt the door open to find his owner! For this reason, he has been used to sleeping in his fosterer’s bedroom. Baxter isn’t keen on being left alone so ideally he is best in a home where his owner is around for most of the time. Despite his fosterer’s best efforts to integrate Baxter with her cats, this has not been entirely successful. We would therefore not place Baxter in a home where there are resident cats.

To adopt Baxter, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.
Please note that Homeless Hounds welcomes applications from Lancashire but unfortunately we are unable to consider applications from further afield. Homeless Hounds cannot rehome dogs to families with children under 5 years old.
Thank you"

This poor boy unfortunately is now looking for a new place to call home.

We have enjoyed getting to know dear Basil, and we have found him to love being around his carers, so we feel he would be happiest having someone in the home a good part of the day.

Basil has started his training and socialisation as it is evident that he hasn't had much done previously. It would be beneficial for Basil to attend training classes with his new owners, and to also have regular canine pals to walk with to continue his social skills as he can struggle when faced with social situations involving some dogs, for this reason this chap wears a muzzle and is kept onlead during his outings.

Basil will be looking to be the only pet in the home, but we feel he could possibly live with teenagers."

Meet Barry, a 1-year-old mixed breed who’s looking for a calm and understanding home where he can feel safe and grow in confidence.
 
Barry is a gentle soul who can be nervous in new situations and around unfamiliar people. While he isn’t the most outgoing dog, he does enjoy quiet affection and his personality starts to shine once he feels secure. 
 
He does best in a relaxed home environment, but he also enjoys outdoor activities like walks, hikes, and playtime in the yard. A home that offers a peaceful indoor atmosphere paired with an active outdoor lifestyle would be the perfect balance for him. Barry may benefit from the companionship of a calm, confident dog to help him feel more at ease. Because he can become overwhelmed, we recommend a home with children over 12 who can respect his space and interact with him gently.
 
Barry is still learning about the world, and he needs a family willing to go at his pace, offering reassurance and structure along the way. With the right support, he has the potential to become a loyal and loving companion.

I'm Barkby and I'm a big friendly guy looking for a home full of love and adventures :)

Age: 2 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Staffie x Cane Corso

Barkby's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers

Barkby is a handsome big lad who came in to us after being found as a stray, sadly nobody came forward to claim him or give us any information on him, so he is now looking for his new forever home.

He is a big playful boy with lots and lots of love to give, he doesn’t quite realise his size at times and tries to greet everyone he meets with lots of enthusiasm! He would definitely benefit from a home with people who had an interest in training and the patience to help teach him some manners and boundaries. This has been started with him here at the rescue and he is doing so well! Although he means no harm anyone interested in him will need to be confident with big dogs.

Barkby absolutely loves playing with toys and running around the secure paddocks here at the rescue and he enjoys being out and about exploring new places too. He can be quite strong on lead but we are working on this and he is already showing improvements when calm, this will need to be continued when he goes to his new home in order to have full control of him when out walking.

We have introduced him to a variety of dogs since being with us and he seems to really like their company! He loves to play but as we expected, he can be too full on for some dogs. We will continue to assess him and mix him further but we do think he may have the potential to live with a compatible dog as long as the introductions go well here at the rescue, but would equally be fine as the only pet too. We feel that he is best suited to a home with sensible older teenagers due to his size and how excitable he can be at times.

Barkby is very eager to please, is quick to learn and is highly trainable – he is very food motivated and focuses on his handler well. He really does have so much potential, he just needs someone with time to put into him!

We really hope that he finds his forever home soon as he will make such an amazing companion 🙂

She is definitely not the dog for a 1st time dog owner. Ongoing training and socialisation is a must for her. She will need someone at home most of the day to give her all the stimulation she will need.

Bambi has interacted well with other dogs whilst in our care so following a successful meet and greet could live with another dog.

No cats for Bambi.

As Bambi came into the home as a stray we have no previous history on her so would prefer any children/visiting children to be 16+ years.

Applications that are successful will be provided with further information on each dog to the best of the charity’s knowledge."

Standing 2.5ft tall and weighing approximately 28kg, Bamba is a calm, gentle soul who rarely barks and gets along wonderfully with both people and other dogs.

Bailey is a bright, bouncy girl looking for an experienced and active home to help her thrive. Originally from a breeder, she was briefly adopted but found the transition overwhelming, so she’s back with us and ready to find the right match.

She’s full of personality—playful, intelligent, and always ready to learn. Bailey knows several commands already, including “sit,” “stay,” “down,” and even “middle.” She’s eager to train, loves having a job to do, and enjoys games like fetch, tracking, and scent work. With the right guidance, she’ll excel in activities that keep her mind and body engaged.

What Bailey Needs in a Home:
A calm, adult-only home with no visiting children.
Experienced owners who understand high-energy dogs and can provide structure.
A quiet, rural setting to help her feel safe and relaxed.
A secure garden with 6ft+ fencing—she’s an athletic girl who loves to jump!
Someone patient and consistent to help her learn how to settle and relax.

Bailey is affectionate, people-oriented, and loves a cuddle when she’s calm. She does struggle with overexcitement and needs clear boundaries, but she’s been making amazing progress. With the right routine, she settles well and is learning how to manage her emotions.

She’s looking for that special person who will see past her quirks and help her reach her full potential. If you’re an active, experienced dog owner who loves a smart, energetic companion, Bailey could be the perfect match for you. Bailey has gained confidence while she has been here with us, and can be homed as an only dog or with kind canine companions that she can lean on and learn from.

Could you be the one to give Bailey the home she’s been waiting for?

To give Bailey the best chance of finding her perfect home, we are happy to waive the standard adoption fee and instead welcome a donation of any amount you feel comfortable with."

Ayla is a gentle 11-year-old Yorkshire Terrier currently enjoying life in our Home Stay scheme while she waits for her forever home. She’s looking for a calm and peaceful household where she can enjoy her favourite things: short strolls, soft toys, and lots of company. Ayla would love access to her own private, secure garden where she can potter about and enjoy the outdoors. She could live with calm dogs or dog-friendly cats, and would be happy in a home with children aged 14 or over who can give her the gentle handling she deserves. Ayla is used to a quiet routine and would suit someone who enjoys a slower pace of life. She is a great match for a first-time owner who has done their research.

Is Ayla right for you?

Ayla is affectionate, well-mannered and full of character. She has lovely recall, walks nicely on a harness, and enjoys meeting new people. She’s relaxed around other dogs and happy to share space with a friendly feline too. Ayla is house-trained, settles overnight, and is used to a varied, balanced diet that includes dry food, cooked meat, and vegetables. While she’s not demanding, she does love companionship and enjoys being near her people. She can be a little sensitive to loud noises and prefers not to be left for long periods. Ayla enjoys playtime with soft toys and is happy to entertain herself if you’re busy. With her sweet nature and steady temperament, Ayla would make a wonderful companion for someone looking to give a senior dog a loving home. AWE licence number 13090 by West Lothian Council."

The staff have worked hard to make me feel better and I'm now able to show my truly loving side...this little lady has one big heart!

I can be worried and nervous at times but once I have trust in my people I take a lot of comfort and reassurance from them, which really helps me when I'm feeling a bit worried. My favourite activity is cuddling and if I could climb into someones pocket I really would. I love my people so much that I struggle when they are not around, so would need a home where my people are around a lot of the time
I don't want to share my home with any other pets, so I can have the people all to myself. I would be better suited to a home with older teenagers as I can get overwhelmed quickly and prefer a calmer atmosphere. As you will have noticed from my pictures I have a condition called 'Cherry eye' in both my eyes that will need to be operated on in about 6 months time but once I've settled into a home so I can have extra TLC when I have my operation.

I came into care after not being treated kindly in my previous home. Thankfully, I was rescued and brought to the centre where I’ve finally been given the love, safety, and care I deserve. Despite my past, I remain full of joy, trust, and affection I’m so ready for a fresh start in a loving forever home.

If you’re looking for a happy, playful, and loving companion who brings sunshine everywhere she goes, I’d love to meet you.

She's quiet and clean in the house, loves a cuddle, gets on well with everyone once she knows you're a safe person, which only takes minutes but she is worried by the big wide world at the moment.

She gets on really well with other dogs and is definitely going to need a confident doggy buddy in the home to help her find her paws.

Ashley would really benefit from some training classes, she likes toys, particularly a game of fetch with a particular ball and she's a bright as a button so she'll learn fast. A quieter home would suit best, willing to help her get out and have fun experiencing things so she can stop worrying about them. I imagine she'd be great at agility.

Following surgery Arnold spent a couple of days in a foster home, this is what they had to say about this big handsome boy…..

Arnold is a young handsome big lad who loves nothing more than snuggling up to his humans. He sometimes forgets his size and sees himself as a lapdog trying to sit on your knee. Arnold is a big boisterous vocal boy who loves to play with his toys. He sometimes forgets his manners when he meets new people and will jump up. He definitely needs to be the only pet in the home.

Arnold is very loyal to his humans. He is house trained and can be left for up to 4-5 hours home alone. During that time he snoozes and chills out. Arnold loves a car ride and travels well. Arnold enjoys his walks – he shows reactivity on the lead and requires continued training help with this.

Arnold is a lovable character who would best suit an adult only pet free home.

To adopt Arnold, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.
Please note that Homeless Hounds welcomes applications from Lancashire but unfortunately we are unable to consider applications from further afield. Homeless Hounds cannot rehome dogs to families with children under 5 years old.

My name is Arni and I am a very handsome big boy :) I can't wait to find my people!

Age: 7 Years 9 Months

Sex: Male

Breed: Doberman

Arni's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with strangers
is toilet trained
can't live with dogs
medical issues

Arni recently arrived with us as a stray and unfortunately his owners never came forward for him.

He is such a big friendly boy, with so much love to give and just needs a lovely home to call his own.
When Arni arrived, he was not in the best condition and it was clear to see he was wobbly on his legs and falling over intermittently, but thankfully can get back up again by himself. We have xrayed him and nothing has shown up of concern, but we are monitoring this on a daily basis.

He arrived with a skin irritation on his back foot, which is looking better than it was, but may require long term treatment, again, due to lack of background, we don’t know how long this has been on going for. Any potential new owners would be welcomed to have a chat with our vets, so all of his information can be fully relayed.

He would love a big garden to potter around in and to play with his favourite tennis balls. Due to Arni’s lack of background, we don’t know if he was born this way, or whether something has come on over time, but he manages fine and is a super happy boy.

He enjoys nothing more than sitting on your knee if he can for a cuddle and showering you with licks. Arni doesn’t seem to be comfortable around other dogs and with being a big fellow, he is strong on lead at times, so is looking for someone that is able to manage him.

We really hope that we find him the perfect home where he can live out his days soon.

Sex: Male
Age:  6 months
Key information: Friendly boy,  can live with children 14 years or over, could possibly live with another similar dog, not good with cats. 

Arlo is a friendly and happy boy who is a lot of fun. Sadly he hasn’t had much training and has learnt to jump up and be very selective in when he wants to listen to you. However he is a very clever dog and when focused he does his best to please you. 

Arlo loves to play, tug, its his favorite, he enjoys running around the garden with his toys and will happily parade them for you once he has caught them. Arlo is a water baby, whether its a paddling pool, river or lake he will go for a quick dip, fetch his toys or cool off. 

Arlo is looking for an active home with people who enjoy training a dog and could invest time and patience in to teaching Arlo basic manners but also some valuable life skills. Arlo has only lived in a house for a short time and during this time he loved his home comforts and is happy to lap up attention and cuddles. New owners would need to be at home most of the day to help him settle in to a good routine.

When out on walks Arlo will happily meet friendly dogs, he can get over excited and wants to play, and if this isn’t possible he can easily become frustrated and become vocal. He is currently learning how to cope with this frustration, and making good progress.

Arlo is a smart boy and has a lovely nature, he does need a lot of 1-2-1 training but once you have put in the hard work he will repay you with loyalty, trust and lots of love. 

if you think you could offer Arlo a home, please don’t hesitate to get in touch."

Arlo is a stunning 1-year-old blue Cane Corso — a true gentle giant looking for a caring foster or foster -to-adopt home.

He is:

Vaccinated, flea and worm treated

Will need to be neutered when old enough

A friendly, lively, and affectionate boy

Intelligent and quick to learn with the right training

Settles well and can be calm when at home

Comfortable being left alone for up to 4 hours

Loving his walks and cuddles with his people

Arlo has previously lived with another dog but may prefer to be the only pet. He has not lived with children and is not suitable for homes with cats. We are seeking an experienced, child-free home familiar with large breeds.

He does bark in the garden, which is typical of the breed, and is currently not keen on car travel, so will require some patient support.

Arlo is a beautiful gentle giant who deserves a patient, loving home to guide him and give him the life he deserves.

Once I know and trust you the real Archie comes out to play - I just love my special mini sized balls and tug toys, we could have so much fun! I am actually very clever and know lots of commands, love enrichment activities and am keen to learn new things. I can also be very sweet and will let you know when you are in my circle of friends as I will approach you for a fuss and even hop on your lap.
I settle very well and would be fine to leave for a period of time, you will most probably find me asleep under my blanket upon your return as I love getting all snuggly and warm. I am not a fan of the rain, mud, getting dirty or being woken up from my snoozing!

Whilst Archie has been returned to us twice, neither occasion was his fault but simply a result of various difficulties faced by the previous owners. Archie came to us initially as part of a pair, but we’ve made the decision to split the duo given the medical issues faced by Archie’s half-brother Dave, and subsequent challenges for Dave’s new owner.  Archie has an absolutely delightful personality and offers up the friendliest grin. After a fairly unsettled few years are you able to give him his forever home?

Owner experience – Archie is a friendly and happy boy. He can be a little vocal on occasion, but is easy enough to manage and as such would be suitable for a first-time owner.  

Personality with people – He can initially be a little slow to warm to new people and may drop any offered treats, but within 5 minutes he’ll be happily accepting them. He has the most lovely smile and, whilst excitable, will still quite calmly say hi and enjoy the attention - chest rubs seem to be particularly appreciated! Once he’s tired he tends to settle alongside you quite happily.

Personality with dogs – On lead and behind a kennel door he has vocalised upon seeing / hearing other dogs. Having said that, he did previously live with his half-brother and feedback from previous owners has indicated he also got on well with other dogs. Following a couple of dog mixes at the rescue, we saw him present a very neutral offering and after one or two sniffs he proceeded to essentially ignore the other dogs whilst they shared the spaced. When the dogs did show interest and offer a rather intrusive nose, he went quite stiff, but with no follow up reaction.

Training & Exercise – Archie’s recall is actually quite strong and his previous owners did suggest he has a number of other tricks and commands in his repertoire. Whilst at the Rescue he has been quite excitable given the particular environmental stresses and we haven’t seen too much beyond an effective recall and an occasional sit / down. However, the opportunity to train Archie presents a great bonding opportunity with his new owner and a chance to keep his mind stimulated. His previous owner did flag that Archie has something of a prey drive and is known to chase cats, horses and squirrels so best to keep him on lead when out on walks. He also has a penchant for soft toys, chasing them down and carrying them around, unlike most terriers the feedback from a previous owner suggested that he doesn’t actually destroy them! He can vocalise when excited during play.

Type of home required – Ideally a home with a secure enclosed garden to offer a comfortable space for him to explore and enjoy.

 

The adoption fee for Archie is £250.00

Description

Anika is a beautiful and slight 3 and a half years old ex-racing Greyhound. She came in with Irish though can be re-homed separately.

Don’t let her racing background put you off! Greyhounds make amazing family dogs and have so much love to give. They only need a moderate amount of exercise and quickly tire out after a burst of the zoomies round our paddock.

Anika has a sweet personality but lacks in confidence so this would need building up. She is a bit wary of traffic and noise so we are looking for a semi-rural or rural location. 

She could potentially live with another dog and this would depend on successful introductions on-site. Anika could potentially live with mature children (15+) who understand to give her space.

She walks lovely on the lead and travels well."

When Angus is around, you can’t help but smile. He is full of fun and mischief and finds it hard to stay still – there’s always something exciting to be doing or exploring. He will need some support for a few behaviours he has shown, but he is very bright and picks up training quickly.

Angus is currently spending some time in a temporary foster home and has settled in well. He travels well in the car, sleeps downstairs overnight and loves affection from his foster carer. He has also become best friends with a teddy bear.

Angus loves playing with his toys, especially tennis balls and soft squeaky ones. Sometimes he can find toys and food too exciting and has displayed some resource guarding behaviour around these, so his owners will need to manage this.

Angus has found being in busy households overwhelming, which can lead to him getting over excitable and finding it hard to relax. He needs a consistent, calm home. We know that Angus isn’t comfortable around younger children, so he cannot live with young children and wouldn't cope with regular visiting ones either.

He is looking to be the only dog in his new home as he has shown some intolerance towards some other dogs and prefers his own space. He can interact with calmer, independent dogs but new owners should not force him to interact with dogs if he chooses not to.

Angus is a quirky boy with a fun personality who loves interacting with people. He also does a great smile! Angus is work in progress but will be a rewarding project."

She’s as sweet-natured as they come, with a gentle spirit that shines like a little beam of sunshine in any room. Angelica absolutely adores a soft, gentle fuss and a slow, peaceful mooch around the yard. She dreams of a home with a lovely garden where she can take her time, stroll in the sun, and simply soak up the warmth.

Angelia will be looking for a home with a very secure garden and tall, non climbable fences as she is a mischievous little lady who has taught herself to climb, so it's vital that she can be kept safe in her new garden.

While Angelica isn’t the most energetic of girls, she treasures her cuddles and loves nothing more than being right by her person’s side, sharing quiet moments together. She’s the kind of companion who will quietly make your day brighter just by being there.

Angelica can live with dog-savvy children who understand that she might need a little time to settle into her new surroundings. She may also do best as an only dog in the right home, especially with adopters who are around most of the time to give her the love and attention she deserves. Alternatively, she could share her home with kind resident dogs or dogs who don’t mind sharing the spotlight.

Though Angelica has not lived in a home before and will need to learn some basics like house training, she is already walking nicely on a lead, a fantastic start for her new life. With patience, love, and gentle guidance, Angelica will blossom into the most loyal and loving companion.

If you’re looking for a calm, affectionate friend who will fill your home with warmth and love, Angelica could be the perfect match. She’s ready to find her forever family and share a lifetime of gentle cuddles and sunny days."

Angel is a sweet girl who was understandably very nervous when she first came to us after being handed in as a stray, unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim her so she is now looking for her forever home.

We did manage to get some more info about her from a member of the public which has given us an insight into her background, unfortunately, her past is a sad one. She did recently find a home but was sadly returned a couple of days later due to the owner struggling to manage her when she got overexcited and started heavily mouthing. This beautiful girl requires plenty of patience and understanding after all she has been through.

She is an extremely loving girl once she gets to know you and loves to give you lots of cuddles! Due to mistreatment when she was younger she can be unsure of new people initially, especially of men but but can be won around quite easily once she knows that you are not going to hurt her. She has sadly had quite a hard life up to now with no stability, and would really benefit from a home with people who will be dedicated to her and her socialisation.

Angel absolutely loves running around playing with toys, especially tennis balls! She is an energetic girl and will require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation in order to meet her needs. She would be the perfect running partner/adventure buddy for someone!

We have been introducing her to other dogs and she seems to get on with them really well out and about, she can potentially live with another dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue. Due to her being a timid girl, she is looking for a home with sensible older teenagers.

We really hope that the right home comes along for her soon as she is struggling with kennel life.

Angel is what we’d call an all rounder. She is easy going, very friendly and is loved by everyone she meets. She enjoys going for walks, is good on the lead and has great recall too. She gets excited for a trip out, especially a ride in the car.

Most of all Angel likes lots of cuddles and treats, her weight will need to be maintained to allow her to continue to enjoy an active healthy life. This bubbly, loving, sweet girl, could fit in anywhere, but would prefer a home without many stairs to navigate. She loves the company of her humans and is great with other dogs. She has been fine with children growing up and has shown no interest cats whilst on her walks.

To adopt Angel, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.

About Angel

Angel is a beautiful 3-year-old greyhound looking for her forever home. Full of energy and enthusiasm, Angel approaches everything with a zest for life! She adores people and is very affectionate, though she can sometimes get a bit overexcited and may jump and bounce to greet you. Very sociable with other dogs, Angel could happily share her home with another hound, given proper introductions. She travels well, enjoys her walks, and would love a home where she has plenty of human company throughout the day.

She was a little shy when she first came into us but is now coming out of herself and showing her wonderful character. DOB 28/07/2018.
 
Angel loves to play with toys – both soft toys and balls and loves nothing more than a good run around in the exercise area. Angel does enjoy a groom and is very patient when being groomed and even bathed. She also travels very well in the car.
 
Angel can still be a little shy with new people and will come for fuss in her own time when she feels she can trust you. She has also not had much socialisation with other dogs so can be unsure when out and about on the lead.
 
We are looking for a family with experience of the husky breed and who would be able to give Angel the patience to get to know them in her own time.
 
NB. Angel came to us suffering from painful bladder crystals.  She has had extensive courses of treatment by our Vet and is much better now.  However this is an ongoing condition and for that reason Angel is looking for a long term foster home. To find out more about fostering please see the info on the website or phone to discuss.
 
If you are interested in Angel, please phone Gyll Mauchline (Between 9:00 and 17:00) on: 01778 424953 or 07708 589792. If you cannot get through, please leave a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible or Email Gyll

Amber is the proud mum to our sweet rescue, Coco. They came to Just for Dogs together, and they’ve been side by side ever since! We’d love to see them rehomed as a pair, but they can be adopted separately within 30 miles of the rescue if needed.
 
Amber is the definition of sweetness—she’s friendly, affectionate, and incredibly loyal. Though she may be a bit reserved at first, once she gets to know you, she will quickly show you just how loving and devoted she can be. She has a calm and gentle nature that makes her an ideal companion for those looking for a laid-back but loving dog.
 
As a larger breed, Amber benefits from having room to stretch her legs and enjoy regular walks and exercise. Her ideal home would be one where she can get the physical and emotional stimulation she needs, while also being given plenty of time for relaxation and comfort. Due to her size, Amber is suited to an adult-only home or with older teens (16+) who can respect her space and manage interactions correctly; providing her with a calm atmosphere with patience, kindness and understanding.

My details

Border Collie 

Female

  1 Year Old

The perfect home

Willow is a beautiful 19 month old Border Collie who is a sweet but sensitive girl. She is looking for an experienced adult only home who have previously owned high energy/ herding breeds. 

Typical of her breed, she thrives on mental and physical stimulation and is on the look out for an active home where she can channel her energy - agility, hoopers or scent work would be perfect outlets for her.

She is house trained and happy to be left alone for short periods. She travels well in the car and would enjoy going on new adventures! Willow could potentially live with another dog dependant on a successful introduction at the Centre and would be better suited to a quiet home that there is low traffic. 

Willow will need to meet her potential adopters several times to build a trusting bond before heading off to her new home. If you're ready for a clever companion and a rewarding project, Willow could be your perfect match.

My details

Pocket Bully

  Male

  2 Years Old

The perfect home

Stan is looking for an adult only home, with someone who can gradually build up the time he is left home alone, as he can find being by himself worrying.


Since being with us, he has shown that he adores being around his handlers. Whenever he hears them coming, he gets very excited and can’t always contain himself when greeting them! When excited, he will jump up and can mouth at hands and arms, but he is learning more appropriate ways of expressing himself!


Stan will need adopters who can help show him that vet trips aren’t too scary. Our staff are currently helping him see the vet room as a positive place, and with continued work in his new home, we can help him to feel more comfortable.


We have introduced Stan to other dogs during his time with us. On approach, he can be unsure, but once he’s had an initial sniff, he soon settles. He prefers the company of calmer dogs, Stan isn't ready to live with another dog at this stage but would do well with walking buddies out and about.

Stan loves playtime! His favourite game is tug of war If you’re after a clever, goofy boy, then Stan’s your man!

My details

Rime - Pointer cross Cloud - Pointer

Females

6 Years Old

The perfect home 

Rime and Cloud are in some ways chalk and cheese and in others, they are two peas in a pod!

Both girls have come from a multi dog household and have shown to have a very close bond. They would be happy to share their new home with another dog also, pending successful meets at the centre to gradually build their confidence.

Rime can be reserved when meeting new people whereas Cloud is first in line for fuss. This helps to give Rime confidence in these situations. Once Rime gets to know you she firmly believes she is of lapdog size, so a family who is keen for sofa snuggles is a must!

Due to Rime’s initial apprehension, both girls will need to be rehomed to a family where there aren’t any children present.

Both girls are spotless in their kennel so we are confident it won’t take them long to pick up on their house training. They can often be seen curling up with one another and this helps to give them comfort when left home alone. 

If you are interested in offering a forever home to our gorgeous girls, please do enquire!

Maverick (Or Mav) came into our care as an unclaimed stray. Since his arrival, he has stolen the hearts of many here at our centre. 

My details

Crossbreed

Male

2 years old

The perfect home

Mav is a friendly lad who likes a good squish and a fuss from his humans. Maverick hasn’t had much training input previously and is still learning some of his basic skills. He is looking for new owners that will dedicate some time to his training. Maverick can live with confident children of 14+ who are used to larger dogs.  

Maverick loves other dogs but can find himself a bit frustrated on lead when he cannot say hello. Maverick can be vocal on lead around dogs and needs some support with this. The behaviour team at Hope can help guide new owners on how to best help Mav on his walks. Maverick would benefit from living at home with a well matched and well rounded dog who can provide him with the companionship he seeks from other dogs and build his confidence when seeing other dogs out and about. 

Mav is looking for new owners who could be around the majority of the day as he would need the time he is left home alone to be built up gradually. Maverick may need support with his house training .

This big girl often forgets her size and bounds round like a pup!

 My details

Bullbreed

Female

2 years old

The perfect home

Mallory adores contact with her handlers and the sight of her handler coming in with her harness ignites that excitement. However Mallory is very engaging and with a tasty treat she soon calms down and is ready to go out on her adventures.

Mallory is a strong girl; she can walk well on lead but when excited or when keen to get somewhere she can forget you are on the other end of the lead. To help with this our staff have been working hard to teach Mallory how to walk on a loose lead and aiding in this she is learning to wear a head collar. 

We have introduced Mallory to other dogs whilst in our care and she is able to socialize with them, preferring quieter dogs who aren’t vocal toward her. She tends to be keen to greet initially and is then happy to walk alongside the other dog, we have found at times she can show some frustrated behaviours such as barking and pulling on lead toward other dogs, this can be managed with food and redirection and is something we will show her new adopters. Currently she would be better suited to being an only dog in her new home. 

We are currently looking for Mallory to be rehomed to an adult only home. We have found although she is a very sweet bouncy girl, she can be a little worried at times and would benefit from a quieter environment at home. Whilst settling in she will need someone home during the day, but this could be built up to being left alone for a few hours over the first few weeks. Mallory is clean in the house and travels well in the car.

My details

French Bulldog 

Female

5 Years Old

The perfect home

Luna can happily walk next to other dogs whilst out exploring; however, she would prefer to be the only dog in the home so she can soak up all the attention.

Luna is doing really well with her house training but may need a little support as she settles into her new home. She's been left up to 3 hours in her foster home and coped well with this. She enjoys food time but she is currently on a diet to help her stay in tip top shape.

Luna would be better suited to a calm home with children aged 10 years and above who can respect her space and gentle nature.

If you are looking for a future snuggle buddy, Luna could be the one for you!

My details

Collie Cross

Female

  7 Years Old

The perfect home

When Gazelle first arrived with us she was under confident but with some patience, treats and toys she has really settled into herself and has shown she will make a wonderful attention to a family home.

She can still be worried in some circumstances so would suit a home where any children are aged 10 and over.
Gazelle loves her walks and would suit an active family who can keep her sharp mind occupied with new adventures and continued training.


We have introduced her to other dogs and have found providing the other dog gives her space initially, she gains in confidence and is happy to walk alongside. She has shown worry and discomfort around boisterous and vocal dogs so is currently looking for a pet free home where she can continue to work on her social skills.


She would suit a home where owners are around during the day to help with toilet training and learning to be left alone.
If you are looking for a small but intelligent dog then Gazelle is the one for you.

The perfect home

Meet Coco and Tux - a lively, lovable duo currently thriving with one of our fabulous foster families. They’ve been described as “bundles of joy and love” and we couldn’t say it better ourselves!


Coco and Tux are full of energy, affection, and charisma. They’re always ready for action – whether that’s heading out on an exciting walk, playing in the garden, or just soaking up all the attention they can get. They’re looking for a family who shares their enthusiasm for life and is ready to include them in plenty of daily adventures.

These two absolutely love human company and would prefer not to be left alone for long. Their new family will need to build up time away gradually,  they’re happiest when they’re part of the action and right by your side! They would love to be the only dogs in the home, but would benefit from social doggy friends of similar size to them.  They could live with children 6+ who are use to dogs with a lot of energy and zest for life. 


Whether they’re out exploring or curled up together after a busy day, Coco and Tux bring double the heart and double the fun.  If you’re looking for two cheerful companions who’ll fill your life with love, laughs, and plenty of paw-sitive energy, Coco and Tux are ready and waiting.

My details

Cane Corso

  Male

  1 Years Old

The perfect home

Cian is  currently looking for an adult only home where owners are keen to continue his education. He can sometimes forget his size and will jump up in excitement, he is currently learning how to keep 4 paws on the floor.

He enjoys getting out for walks and when excited can pull quite a bit so he will need continued work on his loose lead walking, however, he will settle on lead after the initial excitement. Cian loves getting time to burn off some of his energy in our off-lead areas.

We have introduced Cian to other dogs in our care and found he can still be quite puppy like in his behaviour, he gets very excited and will play bow and dance around them, he can be a little rude at times but is learning how to interact appropriately, he could live with the right matched dog in his new home that would engage in play with him but also be a role model for him.

Cian will need new adopters who are around during the day whilst he settles in as he can be unsure about being left alone, he may also need help with his toilet training.


Cian will make a fun addition to his new home where he can let his playful side shine through!

Cane Corso

Female

  1 Year Old

The perfect home

When Cappuccino first arrived with us, she was a worried and nervous girl, unsure of her new surroundings. But with time, patience, and plenty of her favourite treats (she lives for a snack!), she’s made truly heartwarming progress.


This lovely girl is beginning to show her sweet and playful side. She’s learning how much fun toys can be, enjoys a good run around, and has a delightfully goofy streak that’s starting to shine through.


Cappuccino can be strong on the lead, but is learning to walk nicely with her handlers and is especially motivated by food!
She’s looking for a calm, adult-only home where she can continue to grow at her own pace, surrounded by kindness and understanding.

She may also be able to live with another well-matched dog who can show her the ropes and help boost her confidence, pending successful meets at the centre.


If you’ve got a soft spot for sensitive souls and a treat jar at the ready, Cappuccino might just be your perfect match.

About Ludo

Ludo is a beautiful 5-year-old tricolour Cavalier — extra-large in size and even bigger in heart 

He’s a gentle, contented soul who loves being close to his people. He sleeps soundly on the bedroom floor (or your bed, if invited!) and just needs to know you’re nearby. He has been left alone for short periods and has settled well, showing he can build confidence with the right reassurance.

Ludo has good recall, although he’s easily distracted by birds — he loves to chase them! He walks beautifully on a lead, travels brilliantly, and is a joy to have out and about. He can be slightly unsure in new situations, but quickly settles with some encouragement.

He needs to lose around 2kg to help support his joints, and he’s already on the right track. His teeth have been cleaned in rescue, and a daily dental care routine is recommended going forward.

Ludo is food-motivated, loving, and loyal — a classic Cavalier with a few quirks, a big heart, and lots of love to give. He’ll make a fabulous companion in the right home.

Adoption Criteria

Type of home required: A calm home with a secure garden, regular exercise, and humans who enjoy a close companion. Ideal for someone happy to help him continue his weight loss journey and maintain his joint health.

This sweet girl is quite timid and will often run away from you in the kennel, but once scooped into your arms, she begins to relax and enjoys a gentle stroke.

A kind and confident resident dog in her new home is essential to help her learn the ropes and to show her that people can be kind. With patience, love, and a little time, we’re sure Abba will begin to shine and enjoy the life she truly deserves.

Abba is a quietly curious soul who loves to sit and watch the world go by. Everything is new to her, so she will need patient adopters who can offer her the time and kindness she needs to blossom. She has never lived in a home before, so she will need to learn about house training, and her new family will need to gently guide her as she adjusts to the sights, sounds and routines of home life.

Abba doesn't yet know how to walk on a lead and will need to be introduced to this gradually. She will benefit from an active home with adopters who are happy to help her build her confidence and show her just how lovely the outside world can be.
