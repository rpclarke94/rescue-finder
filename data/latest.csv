At any one time we have a number of greyhounds and lurchers in kennels that are looking for a loving home, some may not appear on our website. This could be ‘a dog for you’….a dog that may be matched to you according to the information you provide on the bottom of this profile. Registering your interest here gives you a greater opportunity to be considered for a dog that suits your circumstances, but keep an eye on the website for a dog that you thinks suits you too!

‘A dog for you’ will be a greyhound or lurcher currently in our care who is looking for a loving home.

‘A dog for you’ can suit a range of people with sighthound experience from the novice to the experienced home (experienced homes always very welcome!)

‘A dog for you’ can fit a wide range of living arrangements, but especially popular are rural or semi-rural locations.

‘A dog for you’ will suit your family situation. Whilst some of our dogs can live with children and/or other dogs, many struggle to live with children under 10, or small breed dogs (the latter mainly relating to ex racing greyhounds)

‘A dog for you’ is unlikely to be able to live with cats (or there will be a longer wait)

‘A dog for you’ should be not be expected to have lived in a home before (although some of our dogs may have done)

‘A dog for you’ MAY never be allowed to be let off the lead in a public place due to the natural instinct of the breed.

‘A dog for you’ will need to meet you at our kennel location in Devon, although we occasionally have other dogs which will be homed direct from their current home which could be based in Devon, Dorset, Somerset or Bristol. This may be just the once, or multiple times (depending on the dog).

If you apply for ‘a dog for you’, we will hold onto your application for 3 months, we will review it as new dogs become available. We will contact you to talk through your situation and requirements if we feel we have a match for you, but please, please … keep an eye on the website and apply for a dog if you are interested in them, and think you could be a match. It helps us to speed up the process as we have lots of home offers coming in each week.

Please note, if you have a particular request for a ‘type’ of dog, or fall into some of the categories above that may present a challenge in finding you a suitable dog, we will still happily accept your application as we do get dogs to suit all circumstances. However, it must be accepted that there is a much longer waiting list for these types of dogs. Also in very high demand are small sized, or long coated lurchers.",07/21/2025

Abba,/media/animal_images/AbbaAA.png.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.png,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/2310/,1 year,Female,Beagle Cross,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"03-05-25 Beautiful Abba has come to us from a breeder and is now looking for a loving forever home. This sweet girl is quite timid and will often run away from you in the kennel, but once scooped into your arms, she begins to relax and enjoys a gentle stroke.

A kind and confident resident dog in her new home is essential to help her learn the ropes and to show her that people can be kind. With patience, love, and a little time, we’re sure Abba will begin to shine and enjoy the life she truly deserves.

Abba is a quietly curious soul who loves to sit and watch the world go by. Everything is new to her, so she will need patient adopters who can offer her the time and kindness she needs to blossom. She has never lived in a home before, so she will need to learn about house training, and her new family will need to gently guide her as she adjusts to the sights, sounds and routines of home life.

Abba doesn't yet know how to walk on a lead and will need to be introduced to this gradually. She will benefit from an active home with adopters who are happy to help her build her confidence and show her just how lovely the outside world can be.

About Ludo

Ludo is a beautiful 5-year-old tricolour Cavalier — extra-large in size and even bigger in heart 

He’s a gentle, contented soul who loves being close to his people. He sleeps soundly on the bedroom floor (or your bed, if invited!) and just needs to know you’re nearby. He has been left alone for short periods and has settled well, showing he can build confidence with the right reassurance.

Ludo has good recall, although he’s easily distracted by birds — he loves to chase them! He walks beautifully on a lead, travels brilliantly, and is a joy to have out and about. He can be slightly unsure in new situations, but quickly settles with some encouragement.

He needs to lose around 2kg to help support his joints, and he’s already on the right track. His teeth have been cleaned in rescue, and a daily dental care routine is recommended going forward.

Ludo is food-motivated, loving, and loyal — a classic Cavalier with a few quirks, a big heart, and lots of love to give. He’ll make a fabulous companion in the right home.

Adele,https://sites.create-cdn.net/siteimages/29/4/1/294148/21/2/8/21288885/662x883.jpeg?1732699453,https://www.oakwooddogrescue.co.uk/adele,Age: 11 months old,Sex: Female,Breed: Mixed breed,,HU7 0YQ ,Oakwood Dog Rescue,"Introducing... adorable Adele!

Adele's Story:

Adele is just 11 months old and has spent her whole life living in shelters in Romania and at Oakwood Dog Rescue.

We had a plea from a volunteer rescuer that had just been at the shelter stating that there were 2 pups there that were completely withdrawing into themselves and were starting to shut down. They were very worried that these 2 babies wouldn't survive the winter as they were already so frail, and temperatures had already dropped to -5 degrees. It usually gets to -20 during their winter months.

In the photos, Adele is attached to Beyonce's side. Over time though, these 2 girls have made many new friends and are no longer reliant on each other. They both now kennel share with different dogs and are settled and happy with their groups. Unfortunately, when letting them back together for play dates, it seems that these 2 have really grown apart and no longer enjoy spending time with each other.

Adele has never lived in a home before and so would require time, patience, understanding and lots of positive based training to help her learn the ropes of home life.

ADOPT A DOG,,https://alpetpoundiesrescue.weebly.com/our-dogs-ready-for-adoption.html,,,,Croeslan,,Alpet Poundies Rescue,"Below are the dogs ready to find a loving home. To make sure that any new home will be their forever home, it is important that we balance the needs of the dog with the circumstances of the potential new owner. So before each adoption, we require
a home check
an agreed adoption contract
a minimum adoption donation of £300 for dogs 6 months and older, £400 for puppies under 6 months, £150 for a dog 10+ years old
​For this, the dog will be neutered (if old enough), vaccinated and microchipped before rehoming.

Adopt Ariel,https://k9-rescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ariel-cover.jpg,https://k9-rescue.org/portfolio-items/adopt-ariel/?portfolioCats=17%2C455,5 yrs old (born January 2019),Female – spayed,,Crymych,,K9 Rescue,"Ariel is a sweet and affectionate female 5 year old dog for adoption, who is looking for her loving active family.

Ariel is an active youngster who loves her walks in the countryside and loves to play and bounce around – she adores being around people, Ariel is very gentle so can suit living with dog savvy kids and another dog if introductions go well. She needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Ariel settles nicely and travels well in the car, and loves to go out for walks – she’s a brisk walker so will definitely help her Guardian get their steps in!  She is very affectionate and loves to cuddle with people she knows, yet she is still nervous of new people and situations, so will need a few visits to get to know her new family.

Ariel still needs some work with her recall as when off lead she gets so focused on what she is doing, she becomes ‘deaf’ to being called, yet when she does finally hear us, she becomes super excited and apologetic as if saying ‘ohh, were you calling me?!’  so off-lead training is and will be a must for her, as although people oriented, she is easily distracted.  She loves to play with other dogs, often inviting play with a bow and cheeky bouncing.

In summary, Ariel is a really delightful, good all round dog, who, with just a little bit of training, will absolutely blossom with a new loving family.

Background
All of our dogs have lived their whole lives in family groups in an open space, kennel free environment and it is therefore a shock for them to leave all that they know. For this reason, we require Ariel’s new family to either have an existing resident dog or work from home so she has company through out the day.",07/21/2025

My details

 Husky

  Male

  3 Years Old

The perfect home

Axel is full on energy and would love an active home where he can accompany his new owners on all their adventures, we have found he walks well on lead although but can get distracted with a good scent ahead. 


We have introduced him to other dogs and found he generally gets on with them very well and enjoys a play with the right matched dog; he could happily live with another dog in his new home pending successful introductions at the centre. 


Axel can be a little unsure in some situations so owners will need to help build his confidence, but this shouldn’t take long in the right environment, he is currently looking for a home where any children are aged 14 years and over who can give him space when needed. 
He is likely to need some help with toilet training when first coming home and would need owners who are around during the day to build up any time he is left alone slowly.

Axel is a clever lad who will suit any home who are keen to further his training.

When Cappuccino first arrived with us, she was a worried and nervous girl, unsure of her new surroundings. But with time, patience, and plenty of her favourite treats (she lives for a snack!), she’s made truly heartwarming progress.


This lovely girl is beginning to show her sweet and playful side. She’s learning how much fun toys can be, enjoys a good run around, and has a delightfully goofy streak that’s starting to shine through.


Cappuccino can be strong on the lead, but is learning to walk nicely with her handlers and is especially motivated by food!
She’s looking for a calm, adult-only home where she can continue to grow at her own pace, surrounded by kindness and understanding.

She may also be able to live with another well-matched dog who can show her the ropes and help boost her confidence, pending successful meets at the centre.


If you’ve got a soft spot for sensitive souls and a treat jar at the ready, Cappuccino might just be your perfect match.

The perfect home

Cian is  currently looking for an adult only home where owners are keen to continue his education. He can sometimes forget his size and will jump up in excitement, he is currently learning how to keep 4 paws on the floor.

He enjoys getting out for walks and when excited can pull quite a bit so he will need continued work on his loose lead walking, however, he will settle on lead after the initial excitement. Cian loves getting time to burn off some of his energy in our off-lead areas.

We have introduced Cian to other dogs in our care and found he can still be quite puppy like in his behaviour, he gets very excited and will play bow and dance around them, he can be a little rude at times but is learning how to interact appropriately, he could live with the right matched dog in his new home that would engage in play with him but also be a role model for him.

Cian will need new adopters who are around during the day whilst he settles in as he can be unsure about being left alone, he may also need help with his toilet training.


Cian will make a fun addition to his new home where he can let his playful side shine through!

They’re looking for a family who shares their enthusiasm for life and is ready to include them in plenty of daily adventures.

These two absolutely love human company and would prefer not to be left alone for long. Their new family will need to build up time away gradually,  they’re happiest when they’re part of the action and right by your side! They would love to be the only dogs in the home, but would benefit from social doggy friends of similar size to them.  They could live with children 6+ who are use to dogs with a lot of energy and zest for life. 


Whether they’re out exploring or curled up together after a busy day, Coco and Tux bring double the heart and double the fun.  If you’re looking for two cheerful companions who’ll fill your life with love, laughs, and plenty of paw-sitive energy, Coco and Tux are ready and waiting.

Eric adores people and simply craves cuddles and affection.  He has a timid nature, so can be uncertain on walks, needing some help with confidence building as he often seeks reassurance, yet he loves his walks in the countryside with his brother Ernie who he relies on for confidence – with further patient guidance and understanding from his new family, he will easily blossom into the vibrant, gregarious spirit he’s meant to be!

This kind and incredibly joyful little boy brims with affection and loyalty, he walks nicely on the lead, is great meeting people and dogs out on his walks, and with his love of people he has great recall, although with his timid nature, he can be easily startled, so off-lead walks should be limited to very safe, quiet places, close to home, that he has already got to know very well over a period of time.

Eric is a sweet, gentle soul, whose heart is full of love, so can suit living with dog savvy kids.  He needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Eric becomes much more confident when he is with another dog, as on his own he finds it difficult to cope outside of his safe surroundings, so a home with another dog is a must for Eric, either his new family will have an existing resident dog, or they adopt Eric together with his brother.

In summary, Eric is a really adorable, good natured dog, who, with just a little bit of nurturing, will absolutely flourish with a new loving family.

Gazelle loves her walks and would suit an active family who can keep her sharp mind occupied with new adventures and continued training.


We have introduced her to other dogs and have found providing the other dog gives her space initially, she gains in confidence and is happy to walk alongside. She has shown worry and discomfort around boisterous and vocal dogs so is currently looking for a pet free home where she can continue to work on her social skills.


She would suit a home where owners are around during the day to help with toilet training and learning to be left alone.

Luna can happily walk next to other dogs whilst out exploring; however, she would prefer to be the only dog in the home so she can soak up all the attention.

Luna would be better suited to a calm home with children aged 10 years and above who can respect her space and gentle nature.

The perfect home

Mallory adores contact with her handlers and the sight of her handler coming in with her harness ignites that excitement. However Mallory is very engaging and with a tasty treat she soon calms down and is ready to go out on her adventures.

Mallory is a strong girl; she can walk well on lead but when excited or when keen to get somewhere she can forget you are on the other end of the lead. To help with this our staff have been working hard to teach Mallory how to walk on a loose lead and aiding in this she is learning to wear a head collar. 

We have introduced Mallory to other dogs whilst in our care and she is able to socialize with them, preferring quieter dogs who aren’t vocal toward her. She tends to be keen to greet initially and is then happy to walk alongside the other dog, we have found at times she can show some frustrated behaviours such as barking and pulling on lead toward other dogs, this can be managed with food and redirection and is something we will show her new adopters. Currently she would be better suited to being an only dog in her new home. 

We are currently looking for Mallory to be rehomed to an adult only home. We have found although she is a very sweet bouncy girl, she can be a little worried at times and would benefit from a quieter environment at home. Whilst settling in she will need someone home during the day, but this could be built up to being left alone for a few hours over the first few weeks. Mallory is clean in the house and travels well in the car.

We have found although she is a very sweet bouncy girl, she can be a little worried at times and would benefit from a quieter environment at home. Whilst settling in she will need someone home during the day, but this could be built up to being left alone for a few hours over the first few weeks. Mallory is clean in the house and travels well in the car.

Maverick (Or Mav) came into our care as an unclaimed stray. Since his arrival, he has stolen the hearts of many here at our centre. 

My details

 Crossbreed

 Male

 2 years old

The perfect home

Mav is a friendly lad who likes a good squish and a fuss from his humans. Maverick hasn’t had much training input previously and is still learning some of his basic skills. He is looking for new owners that will dedicate some time to his training. Maverick can live with confident children of 14+ who are used to larger dogs.  

Maverick loves other dogs but can find himself a bit frustrated on lead when he cannot say hello. Maverick can be vocal on lead around dogs and needs some support with this. The behaviour team at Hope can help guide new owners on how to best help Mav on his walks. Maverick would benefit from living at home with a well matched and well rounded dog who can provide him with the companionship he seeks from other dogs and build his confidence when seeing other dogs out and about. 

Mav is looking for new owners who could be around the majority of the day as he would need the time he is left home alone to be built up gradually. Maverick may need support with his house training .

Adopt or Foster Maggie & Kaya,https://k9-rescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Maggie-Kaya-header.jpg,https://k9-rescue.org/portfolio-items/adopt-maggie-kaya/?portfolioCats=17%2C455,Approx 11 yrs old (born 2012-2013),Both Female – spayed,,Crymych,,K9 Rescue,"Maggie and Kaya are two adorable bonded female seniors, who have lived together their whole lives, and are therefore looking for a forever home together.

Born 2012-2013 they are both currently 11 years old, and although incredibly fit and healthy (on walks people guess their age as 3-4 years), finding a home for two dogs of this age together is an impossible dream, so they are available for both adoption or fostering under our Forever Foster Initiative, where we pay all of their food and medical bills; all the family have to do is provide a loving forever home, and cherish them and cuddle them for us!

They are both cuddle monsters; Kaya is full on ‘cuddle me’, whereas Maggie is a bit more reserved, and will give a subtle paw tap to ask for a tummy rub.  They love to have an occasional game of chase or spar fight, and are very good natured whilst playing. They both love their walks out and about, they walk nicely on a lead and are very social with strangers, admired by all who meet them out on their walks, and they particularly adore treat time!  Inside the home, they settle nicely, are fully house-trained and enjoy snoozing on a comfy sofa or in a plush basket.

These adorable girls are very social and polite, yet could do with some off-lead training before being allowed to run free – we totally believe in force-free training and love Tamar Geller‘s Loved Dog Method of teaching so highly recommend her books and podcasts for training.

Background
Maggie and Kaya were both originally found separately as abandoned youngsters in Bulgaria, yet were adopted into the same home in 2013 where they had lived together ever since.  Through no fault of their own, their family circumstances suddenly changed and so were returned to our sanctuary in West Wales under our Full Rescue Back Up For Life scheme.",07/21/2025

My details

 Rime - Pointer cross Cloud - Pointer

 Females

 6 Years Old

The perfect home 

Rime and Cloud are in some ways chalk and cheese and in others, they are two peas in a pod!

Both girls have come from a multi dog household and have shown to have a very close bond. They would be happy to share their new home with another dog also, pending successful meets at the centre to gradually build their confidence.

Rime can be reserved when meeting new people whereas Cloud is first in line for fuss. This helps to give Rime confidence in these situations. Once Rime gets to know you she firmly believes she is of lapdog size, so a family who is keen for sofa snuggles is a must!

Due to Rime’s initial apprehension, both girls will need to be rehomed to a family where there aren’t any children present.

Both girls are spotless in their kennel so we are confident it won’t take them long to pick up on their house training. They can often be seen curling up with one another and this helps to give them comfort when left home alone. 

If you are interested in offering a forever home to our gorgeous girls, please do enquire!

This handsome boy is currently looking for a new home with adopters who have the time and patience to help him thrive and develop into a well-rounded dog.

My details

 Pocket Bully

  Male

  2 Years Old

The perfect home

Stan is looking for an adult only home, with someone who can gradually build up the time he is left home alone, as he can find being by himself worrying.


Since being with us, he has shown that he adores being around his handlers. Whenever he hears them coming, he gets very excited and can’t always contain himself when greeting them! When excited, he will jump up and can mouth at hands and arms, but he is learning more appropriate ways of expressing himself!


Stan will need adopters who can help show him that vet trips aren’t too scary. Our staff are currently helping him see the vet room as a positive place, and with continued work in his new home, we can help him to feel more comfortable.


We have introduced Stan to other dogs during his time with us. On approach, he can be unsure, but once he’s had an initial sniff, he soon settles. He prefers the company of calmer dogs, Stan isn't ready to live with another dog at this stage but would do well with walking buddies out and about.

Stan loves playtime! His favourite game is tug of war If you’re after a clever, goofy boy, then Stan’s your man!

My details

 Border Collie 

 Female

  1 Year Old

The perfect home

Willow is a beautiful 19 month old Border Collie who is a sweet but sensitive girl. She is looking for an experienced adult only home who have previously owned high energy/ herding breeds. 

Typical of her breed, she thrives on mental and physical stimulation and is on the look out for an active home where she can channel her energy - agility, hoopers or scent work would be perfect outlets for her.

She is house trained and happy to be left alone for short periods. She travels well in the car and would enjoy going on new adventures! Willow could potentially live with another dog dependant on a successful introduction at the Centre and would be better suited to a quiet home that there is low traffic. 

Willow will need to meet her potential adopters several times to build a trusting bond before heading off to her new home. If you're ready for a clever companion and a rewarding project, Willow could be your perfect match.

Loyal Companion: Amber is a loving and loyal dog who forms strong bonds with those who earn her trust. Once she feels secure, she blossoms into a wonderful companion.




History: Amber was found as a stray. She has grown so much in confidence since being with us, however, this still needs work. She needs someone who has the time and patience to build a relationship and bond with her.




Experience with Large Breeds: Amber would suit a family who have experience with large, high-energy breeds.




Home Environment: Amber would suit a home where someone is home most of the time; she can sometimes be noisy when left. She would not be suitable to be re-homed with children, cats or other small animals.

﻿

Training Needs: Amber has good basic obedience which is to be built on. This will help her build confidence, adapt to new situations, and settle into her new home successfully. She will need extra work on walking on a lead correctly, and she will also need work in house training as she is not always clean in her kennel. 




Other Dogs: Whilst in our care, Amber was friends with another dog and they played lovely together. However, with new dogs, she can be unsure and needs ongoing work in this area. 




Space for Play and Stimulation: Amber will need a secure garden where she can play and would benefit from lots of mental stimulation; she loves puzzle toys.

Arrival Date
February 2025
Amber is the proud mum to our sweet rescue, Coco. They came to Just for Dogs together, and they’ve been side by side ever since! We’d love to see them rehomed as a pair, but they can be adopted separately within 30 miles of the rescue if needed.
 
Amber is the definition of sweetness—she’s friendly, affectionate, and incredibly loyal. Though she may be a bit reserved at first, once she gets to know you, she will quickly show you just how loving and devoted she can be. She has a calm and gentle nature that makes her an ideal companion for those looking for a laid-back but loving dog.
 
As a larger breed, Amber benefits from having room to stretch her legs and enjoy regular walks and exercise. Her ideal home would be one where she can get the physical and emotional stimulation she needs, while also being given plenty of time for relaxation and comfort. Due to her size, Amber is suited to an adult-only home or with older teens (16+) who can respect her space and manage interactions correctly; providing her with a calm atmosphere with patience, kindness and understanding.

Angel loves to play with toys – both soft toys and balls and loves nothing more than a good run around in the exercise area. Angel does enjoy a groom and is very patient when being groomed and even bathed. She also travels very well in the car.
 
Angel can still be a little shy with new people and will come for fuss in her own time when she feels she can trust you. She has also not had much socialisation with other dogs so can be unsure when out and about on the lead.
 
We are looking for a family with experience of the husky breed and who would be able to give Angel the patience to get to know them in her own time.
 
NB. Angel came to us suffering from painful bladder crystals.  She has had extensive courses of treatment by our Vet and is much better now.  However this is an ongoing condition and for that reason Angel is looking for a long term foster home. To find out more about fostering please see the info on the website or phone to discuss.

About Angel

Angel is a beautiful 3-year-old greyhound looking for her forever home. Full of energy and enthusiasm, Angel approaches everything with a zest for life! She adores people and is very affectionate, though she can sometimes get a bit overexcited and may jump and bounce to greet you. Very sociable with other dogs, Angel could happily share her home with another hound, given proper introductions. She travels well, enjoys her walks, and would love a home where she has plenty of human company throughout the day.

Angel's Notes:

Angel is a sweet girl who was understandably very nervous when she first came to us after being handed in as a stray, unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim her so she is now looking for her forever home.

We did manage to get some more info about her from a member of the public which has given us an insight into her background, unfortunately, her past is a sad one. She did recently find a home but was sadly returned a couple of days later due to the owner struggling to manage her when she got overexcited and started heavily mouthing. This beautiful girl requires plenty of patience and understanding after all she has been through.

She is an extremely loving girl once she gets to know you and loves to give you lots of cuddles! Due to mistreatment when she was younger she can be unsure of new people initially, especially of men but but can be won around quite easily once she knows that you are not going to hurt her. She has sadly had quite a hard life up to now with no stability, and would really benefit from a home with people who will be dedicated to her and her socialisation.

Angel absolutely loves running around playing with toys, especially tennis balls! She is an energetic girl and will require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation in order to meet her needs. She would be the perfect running partner/adventure buddy for someone!

We have been introducing her to other dogs and she seems to get on with them really well out and about, she can potentially live with another dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue. Due to her being a timid girl, she is looking for a home with sensible older teenagers.

We really hope that the right home comes along for her soon as she is struggling with kennel life.

She’s as sweet-natured as they come, with a gentle spirit that shines like a little beam of sunshine in any room. Angelica absolutely adores a soft, gentle fuss and a slow, peaceful mooch around the yard. She dreams of a home with a lovely garden where she can take her time, stroll in the sun, and simply soak up the warmth.

Angelia will be looking for a home with a very secure garden and tall, non climbable fences as she is a mischievous little lady who has taught herself to climb, so it's vital that she can be kept safe in her new garden.

While Angelica isn’t the most energetic of girls, she treasures her cuddles and loves nothing more than being right by her person’s side, sharing quiet moments together. She’s the kind of companion who will quietly make your day brighter just by being there.

Angelica can live with dog-savvy children who understand that she might need a little time to settle into her new surroundings. She may also do best as an only dog in the right home, especially with adopters who are around most of the time to give her the love and attention she deserves. Alternatively, she could share her home with kind resident dogs or dogs who don’t mind sharing the spotlight.

Though Angelica has not lived in a home before and will need to learn some basics like house training, she is already walking nicely on a lead, a fantastic start for her new life. With patience, love, and gentle guidance, Angelica will blossom into the most loyal and loving companion.

If you’re looking for a calm, affectionate friend who will fill your home with warmth and love, Angelica could be the perfect match. She’s ready to find her forever family and share a lifetime of gentle cuddles and sunny days.",07/21/2025
Angus,/sites/default/files/animal_images/068Nz00000TRvRXIA1.webp,https://www.battersea.org.uk/dogs/dog-rehoming-gallery/angus-7981136,"Age 1 Year, 10 Months",Male,Pug,,SW8 4AA,Battersea Dogs Home,"Angus is a lively and exuberant Pug cross who is based at Battersea Old Windsor.

When Angus is around, you can’t help but smile. He is full of fun and mischief and finds it hard to stay still – there’s always something exciting to be doing or exploring. He will need some support for a few behaviours he has shown, but he is very bright and picks up training quickly.

Angus is currently spending some time in a temporary foster home and has settled in well. He travels well in the car, sleeps downstairs overnight and loves affection from his foster carer. He has also become best friends with a teddy bear.

Angus loves playing with his toys, especially tennis balls and soft squeaky ones. Sometimes he can find toys and food too exciting and has displayed some resource guarding behaviour around these, so his owners will need to manage this.

Angus has found being in busy households overwhelming, which can lead to him getting over excitable and finding it hard to relax. He needs a consistent, calm home. We know that Angus isn’t comfortable around younger children, so he cannot live with young children and wouldn't cope with regular visiting ones either.

He is looking to be the only dog in his new home as he has shown some intolerance towards some other dogs and prefers his own space. He can interact with calmer, independent dogs but new owners should not force him to interact with dogs if he chooses not to.

Angus is a quirky boy with a fun personality who loves interacting with people. He also does a great smile! Angus is work in progress but will be a rewarding project.",07/21/2025

Description

Anika is a beautiful and slight 3 and a half years old ex-racing Greyhound. She came in with Irish though can be re-homed separately.

Don’t let her racing background put you off! Greyhounds make amazing family dogs and have so much love to give. They only need a moderate amount of exercise and quickly tire out after a burst of the zoomies round our paddock.

Anika has a sweet personality but lacks in confidence so this would need building up. She is a bit wary of traffic and noise so we are looking for a semi-rural or rural location. 

She could potentially live with another dog and this would depend on successful introductions on-site. Anika could potentially live with mature children (15+) who understand to give her space.

She walks lovely on the lead and travels well. ",07/21/2025

I'm a young adult girl
Medium sized
I prefer to live with adults only
I may be able to live with cats
I may be able to live with other dogs
I need a quiet home, I would need my new owner to take me to training classes, I need some time to get to know new people

There is a new chow chow in the building! Our girl Apricot arrived in our care as a stray, scared and confused as to where her owners were. Unfortunately , upon arrival the team noticed that Apricot was lame in her hind leg. She was quickly taken to the vets who said she had a potential cruciate ligament rupture… we got her booked in for x rays which confirmed this diagnosis and lucky for her she was able to have her surgery that same day.

Apricots surgery went well and she is now in recovery. she is currently on crate rest and is recovering very well (a bit too well as she thinks she can go on super long walks again instead of wee breaks!) her incision is healing nicely and we are hopeful that she will soon be up and about again for walks with our volunteers.

Miss Apricot is a very sweet girl, she can be worried about people and can take a while to come around. But, Once she trusts you this girls confidence blooms, she will roll over onto her back and ask for belly rubs by making funny grunts and huffs ! And she also has that hilarious chow chow sassiness when she wants something that we all love! Apricot really enjoys walking & would go for miles if she hadn’t just had surgery! She would be a lovely walking buddy for somebody once she is properly recovered .

Apricot is looking for a home that have experience with the breed or similar, she will need regular grooming and washes to keep her luscious locks nice and tidy & requires regular cleaning of her face area . She has shown lots of interest in dogs whilst out so we would be happy to place her with another neutered resident pal depending on intros. She could potentially live with cats but is looking for an adult only home as of right now.

ARCHIE,/slir/w500-h394-c500.394/webroot/uploads/dogs/2025/Archie%20503%20A.jpg,https://stokenchurchdogrescue.org.uk/dogs/archie-503,Age : 8 years old (approx.),Male,Border Terrier Type,,HP14 3TD,Stokenchurch Dog Rescue,"CLICK HERE FOR OUR PRE-ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE

Whilst Archie has been returned to us twice, neither occasion was his fault but simply a result of various difficulties faced by the previous owners. Archie came to us initially as part of a pair, but we’ve made the decision to split the duo given the medical issues faced by Archie’s half-brother Dave, and subsequent challenges for Dave’s new owner.  Archie has an absolutely delightful personality and offers up the friendliest grin. After a fairly unsettled few years are you able to give him his forever home?

Owner experience – Archie is a friendly and happy boy. He can be a little vocal on occasion, but is easy enough to manage and as such would be suitable for a first-time owner.  

Personality with people – He can initially be a little slow to warm to new people and may drop any offered treats, but within 5 minutes he’ll be happily accepting them. He has the most lovely smile and, whilst excitable, will still quite calmly say hi and enjoy the attention - chest rubs seem to be particularly appreciated! Once he’s tired he tends to settle alongside you quite happily.

Personality with dogs – On lead and behind a kennel door he has vocalised upon seeing / hearing other dogs. Having said that, he did previously live with his half-brother and feedback from previous owners has indicated he also got on well with other dogs. Following a couple of dog mixes at the rescue, we saw him present a very neutral offering and after one or two sniffs he proceeded to essentially ignore the other dogs whilst they shared the spaced. When the dogs did show interest and offer a rather intrusive nose, he went quite stiff, but with no follow up reaction.

Training & Exercise – Archie’s recall is actually quite strong and his previous owners did suggest he has a number of other tricks and commands in his repertoire. Whilst at the Rescue he has been quite excitable given the particular environmental stresses and we haven’t seen too much beyond an effective recall and an occasional sit / down. However, the opportunity to train Archie presents a great bonding opportunity with his new owner and a chance to keep his mind stimulated. His previous owner did flag that Archie has something of a prey drive and is known to chase cats, horses and squirrels so best to keep him on lead when out on walks. He also has a penchant for soft toys, chasing them down and carrying them around, unlike most terriers the feedback from a previous owner suggested that he doesn’t actually destroy them! He can vocalise when excited during play.

Type of home required – Ideally a home with a secure enclosed garden to offer a comfortable space for him to explore and enjoy.

 

The adoption fee for Archie is £250.00

I am going to need quite a special home that's nice and quiet with an experienced owner who will give me lots of time, patience, reassurance and understanding as I am a very worried and scared little boy.
Once I know and trust you the real Archie comes out to play - I just love my special mini sized balls and tug toys, we could have so much fun! I am actually very clever and know lots of commands, love enrichment activities and am keen to learn new things. I can also be very sweet and will let you know when you are in my circle of friends as I will approach you for a fuss and even hop on your lap.
I settle very well and would be fine to leave for a period of time, you will most probably find me asleep under my blanket upon your return as I love getting all snuggly and warm. I am not a fan of the rain, mud, getting dirty or being woken up from my snoozing!
I wouldn't be able to live with cats or dogs I'm afraid, but if you have an adult only home and would be willing to handle me carefully and build up my confidence I would love to meet you and show you the real Archie x

Arlo is a stunning 1-year-old blue Cane Corso — a true gentle giant looking for a caring foster or foster -to-adopt home.

He is:

Vaccinated, flea and worm treated

Will need to be neutered when old enough

A friendly, lively, and affectionate boy

Intelligent and quick to learn with the right training

Settles well and can be calm when at home

Comfortable being left alone for up to 4 hours

Loving his walks and cuddles with his people

Arlo has previously lived with another dog but may prefer to be the only pet. He has not lived with children and is not suitable for homes with cats. We are seeking an experienced, child-free home familiar with large breeds.

He does bark in the garden, which is typical of the breed, and is currently not keen on car travel, so will require some patient support.

Arlo is a beautiful gentle giant who deserves a patient, loving home to guide him and give him the life he deserves.

If you are interested in fostering or foster to adopting Arlo, please contact: mail@stfrancisnewquay.org.uk

Sex: Male
Age:  6 months
Key information: Friendly boy,  can live with children 14 years or over, could possibly live with another similar dog, not good with cats. 

Arlo is a friendly and happy boy who is a lot of fun. Sadly he hasn’t had much training and has learnt to jump up and be very selective in when he wants to listen to you. However he is a very clever dog and when focused he does his best to please you. 

Arlo loves to play, tug, its his favorite, he enjoys running around the garden with his toys and will happily parade them for you once he has caught them. Arlo is a water baby, whether its a paddling pool, river or lake he will go for a quick dip, fetch his toys or cool off. 

Arlo is looking for an active home with people who enjoy training a dog and could invest time and patience in to teaching Arlo basic manners but also some valuable life skills. Arlo has only lived in a house for a short time and during this time he loved his home comforts and is happy to lap up attention and cuddles. New owners would need to be at home most of the day to help him settle in to a good routine.

When out on walks Arlo will happily meet friendly dogs, he can get over excited and wants to play, and if this isn’t possible he can easily become frustrated and become vocal. He is currently learning how to cope with this frustration, and making good progress.

Arlo is a smart boy and has a lovely nature, he does need a lot of 1-2-1 training but once you have put in the hard work he will repay you with loyalty, trust and lots of love. 

if you think you could offer Arlo a home, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Age: 7 Years 9 Months

Sex: Male

Breed: Doberman

Arni's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with strangers
is toilet trained
can't live with dogs
medical issues

Arni recently arrived with us as a stray and unfortunately his owners never came forward for him.

He is such a big friendly boy, with so much love to give and just needs a lovely home to call his own.
When Arni arrived, he was not in the best condition and it was clear to see he was wobbly on his legs and falling over intermittently, but thankfully can get back up again by himself. We have xrayed him and nothing has shown up of concern, but we are monitoring this on a daily basis.

He arrived with a skin irritation on his back foot, which is looking better than it was, but may require long term treatment, again, due to lack of background, we don’t know how long this has been on going for. Any potential new owners would be welcomed to have a chat with our vets, so all of his information can be fully relayed.

He would love a big garden to potter around in and to play with his favourite tennis balls. Due to Arni’s lack of background, we don’t know if he was born this way, or whether something has come on over time, but he manages fine and is a super happy boy.

He enjoys nothing more than sitting on your knee if he can for a cuddle and showering you with licks. Arni doesn’t seem to be comfortable around other dogs and with being a big fellow, he is strong on lead at times, so is looking for someone that is able to manage him.

We really hope that we find him the perfect home where he can live out his days soon.

Following surgery Arnold spent a couple of days in a foster home, this is what they had to say about this big handsome boy…..

Arnold is a young handsome big lad who loves nothing more than snuggling up to his humans. He sometimes forgets his size and sees himself as a lapdog trying to sit on your knee. Arnold is a big boisterous vocal boy who loves to play with his toys. He sometimes forgets his manners when he meets new people and will jump up. He definitely needs to be the only pet in the home.

Arnold is very loyal to his humans. He is house trained and can be left for up to 4-5 hours home alone. During that time he snoozes and chills out. Arnold loves a car ride and travels well. Arnold enjoys his walks – he shows reactivity on the lead and requires continued training help with this.

Arnold is a lovable character who would best suit an adult only pet free home.

Arthur came into the center along with his siblings, after his owner had an accidental litter and they were unable to care for them.  He hasn't had the easiest start in life, but this cheeky chap is ready for his own family.

He is looking for patient owners who will guide him with positive reinforcement training and socialisation. We strongly recommend puppy classes to help him continue to build his confidence and grow into a loving, well-rounded companion.

Whilst we don’t know exactly how big Arthur’s parents were, due to his breed we expect him to grow into a large, strong dog. It is easy to fall for Arthur’s wrinkly face, but it is important adopters carefully consider the long-term costs and commitment to his breed.

To help Arthur transition into his new home, he will need plenty of time with new owners at home for house training and settling in. Slowly increasing alone time will help him feel more comfortable as he adjusts.

Arthur would prefer quieter walking areas initially, where we can continue to build his confidence and experience the world.

Arthur can live with older children 16+, and adopters should keep in mind that his puppy teeth may be painful during the teething stage. Patience and training will help him through this stage.

He already knows lots of basic commands such as sit, down, paw and is eager to learn more with his family.

Arthur can live with other pets, but it is important to manage introductions carefully as Arthur hasn't had lots of socialising and does lack some confidence. With slow, positive introductions, he has the potential to form positive relationships with other animals in the household.

She's quiet and clean in the house, loves a cuddle, gets on well with everyone once she knows you're a safe person, which only takes minutes but she is worried by the big wide world at the moment.

She gets on really well with other dogs and is definitely going to need a confident doggy buddy in the home to help her find her paws.

Ashley would really benefit from some training classes, she likes toys, particularly a game of fetch with a particular ball and she's a bright as a button so she'll learn fast. A quieter home would suit best, willing to help her get out and have fun experiencing things so she can stop worrying about them. I imagine she'd be great at agility.

I absolutely adore people and thrive on attention, cuddles, and playtime. I’ve got a happy, bouncy energy and sometimes get a little too excited but it’s only because I’m so thrilled to be around you.

I love toys, especially the ones I can throw around and chase, and once I’ve had a bit of fun, I settle nicely and will happily snuggle up close for a cuddle. I’m the kind of dog who’s just as happy playing as I am curled up on the sofa next to you.

I get along well with other dogs and could be a lovely companion to a friendly canine pal, as long as we’re a good match. I enjoy making new friends, both human and doggy, and bring a cheerful, friendly energy to everything I do.

I came into care after not being treated kindly in my previous home. Thankfully, I was rescued and brought to the centre where I’ve finally been given the love, safety, and care I deserve. Despite my past, I remain full of joy, trust, and affection I’m so ready for a fresh start in a loving forever home.

If you’re looking for a happy, playful, and loving companion who brings sunshine everywhere she goes, I’d love to meet you.

My name is Audrey and I'm a little chihuahua cross who is around 5 years old. I'm a stray so not much is known about my history but I did arrive in a bit of a sorry state and feeling worried by the world. The staff have worked hard to make me feel better and I'm now able to show my truly loving side...this little lady has one big heart!

I can be worried and nervous at times but once I have trust in my people I take a lot of comfort and reassurance from them, which really helps me when I'm feeling a bit worried. My favourite activity is cuddling and if I could climb into someones pocket I really would. I love my people so much that I struggle when they are not around, so would need a home where my people are around a lot of the time
I don't want to share my home with any other pets, so I can have the people all to myself. I would be better suited to a home with older teenagers as I can get overwhelmed quickly and prefer a calmer atmosphere. As you will have noticed from my pictures I have a condition called 'Cherry eye' in both my eyes that will need to be operated on in about 6 months time but once I've settled into a home so I can have extra TLC when I have my operation.

Ayla is a gentle 11-year-old Yorkshire Terrier currently enjoying life in our Home Stay scheme while she waits for her forever home. She’s looking for a calm and peaceful household where she can enjoy her favourite things: short strolls, soft toys, and lots of company. Ayla would love access to her own private, secure garden where she can potter about and enjoy the outdoors. She could live with calm dogs or dog-friendly cats, and would be happy in a home with children aged 14 or over who can give her the gentle handling she deserves. Ayla is used to a quiet routine and would suit someone who enjoys a slower pace of life. She is a great match for a first-time owner who has done their research.

Is Ayla right for you?

Ayla is affectionate, well-mannered and full of character. She has lovely recall, walks nicely on a harness, and enjoys meeting new people. She’s relaxed around other dogs and happy to share space with a friendly feline too. Ayla is house-trained, settles overnight, and is used to a varied, balanced diet that includes dry food, cooked meat, and vegetables. While she’s not demanding, she does love companionship and enjoys being near her people. She can be a little sensitive to loud noises and prefers not to be left for long periods. Ayla enjoys playtime with soft toys and is happy to entertain herself if you’re busy. With her sweet nature and steady temperament, Ayla would make a wonderful companion for someone looking to give a senior dog a loving home.

Bailey is a bright, bouncy girl looking for an experienced and active home to help her thrive. Originally from a breeder, she was briefly adopted but found the transition overwhelming, so she’s back with us and ready to find the right match.

She’s full of personality—playful, intelligent, and always ready to learn. Bailey knows several commands already, including “sit,” “stay,” “down,” and even “middle.” She’s eager to train, loves having a job to do, and enjoys games like fetch, tracking, and scent work. With the right guidance, she’ll excel in activities that keep her mind and body engaged.

What Bailey Needs in a Home:
A calm, adult-only home with no visiting children.
Experienced owners who understand high-energy dogs and can provide structure.
A quiet, rural setting to help her feel safe and relaxed.
A secure garden with 6ft+ fencing—she’s an athletic girl who loves to jump!
Someone patient and consistent to help her learn how to settle and relax.

Bailey is affectionate, people-oriented, and loves a cuddle when she’s calm. She does struggle with overexcitement and needs clear boundaries, but she’s been making amazing progress. With the right routine, she settles well and is learning how to manage her emotions.

She’s looking for that special person who will see past her quirks and help her reach her full potential. If you’re an active, experienced dog owner who loves a smart, energetic companion, Bailey could be the perfect match for you. Bailey has gained confidence while she has been here with us, and can be homed as an only dog or with kind canine companions that she can lean on and learn from.

Could you be the one to give Bailey the home she’s been waiting for?

Standing 2.5ft tall and weighing approximately 28kg, Bamba is a calm, gentle soul who rarely barks and gets along wonderfully with both people and other dogs.

Barkby's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers

Barkby is a handsome big lad who came in to us after being found as a stray, sadly nobody came forward to claim him or give us any information on him, so he is now looking for his new forever home.

He is a big playful boy with lots and lots of love to give, he doesn’t quite realise his size at times and tries to greet everyone he meets with lots of enthusiasm! He would definitely benefit from a home with people who had an interest in training and the patience to help teach him some manners and boundaries. This has been started with him here at the rescue and he is doing so well! Although he means no harm anyone interested in him will need to be confident with big dogs.

Barkby absolutely loves playing with toys and running around the secure paddocks here at the rescue and he enjoys being out and about exploring new places too. He can be quite strong on lead but we are working on this and he is already showing improvements when calm, this will need to be continued when he goes to his new home in order to have full control of him when out walking.

We have introduced him to a variety of dogs since being with us and he seems to really like their company! He loves to play but as we expected, he can be too full on for some dogs. We will continue to assess him and mix him further but we do think he may have the potential to live with a compatible dog as long as the introductions go well here at the rescue, but would equally be fine as the only pet too. We feel that he is best suited to a home with sensible older teenagers due to his size and how excitable he can be at times.

Barkby is very eager to please, is quick to learn and is highly trainable – he is very food motivated and focuses on his handler well. He really does have so much potential, he just needs someone with time to put into him!

We really hope that he finds his forever home soon as he will make such an amazing companion 🙂

Meet Barry, a 1-year-old mixed breed who’s looking for a calm and understanding home where he can feel safe and grow in confidence.
 
Barry is a gentle soul who can be nervous in new situations and around unfamiliar people. While he isn’t the most outgoing dog, he does enjoy quiet affection and his personality starts to shine once he feels secure. 
 
He does best in a relaxed home environment, but he also enjoys outdoor activities like walks, hikes, and playtime in the yard. A home that offers a peaceful indoor atmosphere paired with an active outdoor lifestyle would be the perfect balance for him. Barry may benefit from the companionship of a calm, confident dog to help him feel more at ease. Because he can become overwhelmed, we recommend a home with children over 12 who can respect his space and interact with him gently.
 
Barry is still learning about the world, and he needs a family willing to go at his pace, offering reassurance and structure along the way. With the right support, he has the potential to become a loyal and loving companion.

At just over a year old, he’s full of playful energy and has a lot of love to give but he can find being on his own a little overwhelming at times.

He’s looking for a home where someone is around most of the time to help him build confidence and learn that independence can be a positive experience. Basil would benefit from continued training and routine to help guide him through his teenage phase — he’s still very puppy-like in many ways!

Basil may be able to live with another well-matched dog of similar size, pending successful introductions, and could live with older, dog-savvy children (secondary school age and up).

Ideally, his new owner will have experience with large breeds or be confident in handling bigger dogs. With time, consistency, and plenty of positive encouragement, Basil will make a brilliant companion.

If you’re ready for a bouncy best friend with bags of potential, Basil might be just the one for you.

Baxter,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unknown-1.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/baxter/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Baxter is a very lively young Frenchie who is around 2 years old. He’s a strong boy with bags of energy and would love to have a garden to run around in to burn off some of that energy. He can be boisterous at times and he would enjoy living in a home where there is plenty of activities to keep him stimulated. He has lived with another dog and has been very happy to have canine company.

He doesn’t seem to get possessive over toys or his owner’s attention but he can be rather clumsy which some other dogs might find rather annoying. He can walk very well on a lead but does tend to pull quite strongly at times particularly to inspect interesting looking lampposts! He can also get very excited when he sees other dogs out and about and he will vocalise his excitement at some volume particularly when he is out walking with another doggie companion.

Baxter is a very obedient boy and knows basic commands. He’s eager to please, very responsive to training and has bags of potential for an owner with the time to train him. Baxter doesn’t like sleeping in a crate and is able to successfully head butt the door open to find his owner! For this reason, he has been used to sleeping in his fosterer’s bedroom. Baxter isn’t keen on being left alone so ideally he is best in a home where his owner is around for most of the time. Despite his fosterer’s best efforts to integrate Baxter with her cats, this has not been entirely successful. We would therefore not place Baxter in a home where there are resident cats.

To adopt Baxter, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.

Flo,https://lirp.cdn-website.com/76b94d75/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_1524-1920w.jpg,https://www.pawsalrewas.co.uk/meet-our-dogs,Approximately 10-12 Months,Female,Belgian Malinois Cross,,DE13 7BD,Paws A While Shelter,"Flo is a sweet girl who loves affection. She is a loyal and loving dog who once trust is built, forms a strong bond.



History: Flo was found as a stray. She continues to grow in confidence since her arrival, however, this still needs work. She needs someone who has the time and patience to build a relationship and bond with her.


Experience with Malinios': Flo's adopters should have experience with Malinios' as the breed experience will help her to thrive.


Home Environment: Flo would suit an active home and someone being home most of the time. She would not be suitable to be rehomed with children (due to her age and size), cats or other small animals. There should also be no visiting children to the house.


Training Needs: Flo has some basic training, she will need on-going work in this area. This will help her build confidence, adapt to new situations, and settle into her new home successfully. She may need work on house training as she is not consistently clean in her kennel.


Space for Play and Stimulation: Flo will need a secure garden with a high fence. She would benefit from lots of mental stimulation and enrichment. 


Health Note: Flo had an injury to her front left paw when she arrived, after an x-ray, it showed that all the toes have been broken at some point in her short life and have not healed correctly. While she is currently comfortable and is taking a joint supplement, she may be prone to developing arthritis or mobility issues later in life. This is something her future adopter will need to monitor and manage with veterinary support as needed.

Loyal Companion: Amber is a loving and loyal dog who forms strong bonds with those who earn her trust. Once she feels secure, she blossoms into a wonderful companion.




History: Amber was found as a stray. She has grown so much in confidence since being with us, however, this still needs work. She needs someone who has the time and patience to build a relationship and bond with her.




Experience with Large Breeds: Amber would suit a family who have experience with large, high-energy breeds.




Home Environment: Amber would suit a home where someone is home most of the time; she can sometimes be noisy when left. She would not be suitable to be re-homed with children, cats or other small animals.




Training and Abilities: Amber has good basic obedience and walks nicely on lead. She's an intelligent dog who enjoys scent work and has even shown promise with basic agility skills. These activities are fantastic outlets for her and will help build her confidence and strengthen the bond with her adopters.




Other Dogs: Whilst in our care, Amber was friends with another dog and they played lovely together. However, with new dogs, she can be unsure and needs ongoing work in this area. ﻿




Space for Play and Stimulation: Amber will need a secure garden where she can play and would benefit from lots of mental stimulation; she loves puzzle toys.

His wagging tail and affectionate nature make him a joy to be around, and once he settles into his new home, you’ll have a bond for life.




Loyal Companion: He adores human company and thrives in a home where he has companionship throughout the day, as he can sometimes become destructive when left alone in his kennel.


Energy & Exercise Needs: Pete is a bundle of joy. He loves a good walk and enjoys off-lead play for about 20 minutes before happily settling down on a comfy sofa or bed to relax.


Walking & Awareness: On the lead, he walks beautifully, making strolls with him a pleasure. However, as a sighthound, he has a keen eye for small animals and will notice them long before you do, so awareness and management on walks are important.


Socialisation & Other Animals: Pete loves meeting people and always greets them with a wagging tail. He could potentially live with another dog, but slow introductions would be necessary. He could also live with dog-savvy children, but he is not suitable to live with cats or small animals.


Experience with Sighthounds: A home with sighthound experience would be ideal, but not required, as understanding his natural instincts will help him thrive.


Training Needs: His basic training is still a work in progress, so ongoing training will be beneficial to help him settle and develop good manners. He is also not consistently clean in his kennel, so this may need some work once in a home.
 

If you’re looking for an affectionate, fun-loving companion and have the time to continue his training and provide him with the exercise and care he needs, Pete could be the perfect addition.



Meet and greets will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to a suitable adoption application.

Rizzo,https://lirp.cdn-website.com/76b94d75/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_0423-1920w.jpg,https://www.pawsalrewas.co.uk/meet-our-dogs,3 Years Old,Female,Border Collie,,DE13 7BD,Paws A While Shelter,"Rizzo's journey highlights her resilience and the potential for growth with the right environment and care. Here’s a comprehensive overview of Rizzo's needs and ideal home situation:

﻿

Previous Home Environment: Rizzo was surrendered to the rescue after her family realized they could not provide her with the necessary time, stimulation, and exercise. The busy home environment was overwhelming for her, prompting the need for a calmer setting.




Loyal Companion: Rizzo is a loving and loyal dog who forms strong bonds with those who earn her trust. Once she feels secure, she blossoms into a wonderful companion.




Playful Nature: She has a strong love for tennis balls and enjoys structured play, making activities like scent games very beneficial for her mental and physical stimulation.




Calming Influence: Rizzo has a calm demeanour and interacts well with other dogs, often acting as a role model and helping to teach confidence to other dogs in the rescue.




Sensory Sensitivity: Like many Border Collies, Rizzo can be sensitive to noises and unfamiliar situations (e.g., vacuums, TVs, and objects on wheels). However, with time, patience, and exposure to these elements in training, she has shown improvement.




Experience with Border Collies: Rizzo would thrive in a home with someone who has experience with her breed. Understanding her herding instinct and sensitivity is vital for her development and comfort.




Calm Home Environment: Given her background, Rizzo would do best in a calmer household, ideally without children or with only visiting children, as a busy environment can be stressful for her.




Training Focus: A commitment to reward-based training is essential for Rizzo, as it helps her build confidence, adapt to new situations, and settle into her new home successfully. She will benefit from structured training sessions and consistent reinforcement of positive behaviours.




Multiple Meet and Greets: Before adoption, Rizzo should have several meet and greets with potential adopters to build trust and ensure that she feels comfortable in her new environment.




Space for Play and Stimulation: Rizzo will need an environment that allows for plenty of exercise and mental challenges. Access to a secure garden where she can safely play and explore is ideal.




Rizzo is a loving dog with the potential for a wonderful companionship if she is placed in the right home. With her intelligence and eagerness to bond, along with a dedicated and experienced owner, Rizzo can flourish. If you are looking for a sweet and loyal companion who needs a little patience and understanding, Rizzo might be the perfect fit for you!




Meet and Greet with Rizzo will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to suitable adoption application.

﻿

Initial struggles: Oaty had a tough time adjusting to kennel life due to a bad experience with a crate and the stress of being in a new environment.




Building trust: The staff and volunteers worked hard to build Oaty's trust, and he has learned to see the kennel as a safe space. Crating is not advisable




Wary of strangers: Oaty can be cautious around people he doesn't know, especially when it comes to personal space and touch. He is muzzle-trained for grooming and vet visits.




Affectionate with trusted individuals: Oaty is very affectionate with staff and volunteers who have taken the time to bond with him and gain his trust.




Confident around dogs: Oaty is generally confident and calm around most dogs and enjoys social walks off-site.




Cat-chasing: Oaty has a strong desire to chase cats, which is a work in progress. We would not recommend that Oaty is re-homed with cats.




Intelligent and active: Oaty is an intelligent and active dog who needs mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom.




Suitable home: Oaty would thrive in an adult-only home with no visiting children, where his owners can take the time to build a relationship and bond with him.




Overall, Oaty is a wonderful little dog who has overcome some challenges and is now ready for a forever home where he can receive the love, care, and attention he deserves.




Meet and Greet with Oaty will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to suitable adoption application.

Here are some key points about Jasper's personality and needs:




Cheeky and playful: Jasper loves to have fun and show everyone a good time, especially in his kennel.




Loves company: Jasper craves attention and affection from people, and he's a sweet dog who loves to cuddle and greet everyone he meets.




Needs reassurance: Jasper lacks confidence, but his time in foster care has helped him build some self-assurance. He still requires further support to boost his confidence.




Intelligent and trainable: Jasper is a smart dog who picks up on training quickly and enjoys interacting with people and his toys.




Nervous in certain situations: Jasper can become nervous around people and certain dogs on occasion, especially in stressful situations. This can lead him to reacting to other dogs by barking.
He will need on going when meeting new dogs out and about.




Good recall but needs improvement: Jasper has good basic training and his recall is generally good, but he would benefit from further training in this area.




Requires a patient owner: Jasper needs an owner who is understanding of dog body language and willing to use reward-based training to help him build confidence.




Needs regular grooming: Jasper requires regular grooming to keep his coat in good condition.


Living arrangements: Jasper requires company during the day and to be the only pet in house. He would benefit from a reasonable-sized garden for playtime and zoomies, and an owner who is willing to invest time in training and socialization. However, due to his nervous nature, Jasper is not suitable for households with children.







Overall, Jasper is a lovable and playful dog who requires a patient and understanding owner who can provide him with the care and attention he needs to thrive.




Meet and Greet with Jasper will need to be arranged by appointment only, subject to suitable adoption application.

Can I be rehomed with children… Over 10 years

Can I be rehomed with other dogs… NO

Can I be rehomed with cats… NO

MY HISTORY

Arnie has been a well loved dog since a  puppy. Sadly due to not getting on with the resident dog, he is looking for a new home. Arnie is still living with his owner and waiting for a placement with us. We would welcome applications from families who may wish to ‘foster with a view to adopt’ where we can get him straight into a foster placement. Please email us for more information on how this works.

ABOUT ARNIE

Hi, I’m Arnie.

I’m a super friendly chap who loves to meet new people!

I really enjoy treats and know the commands ‘sit’, ‘paw’ and ‘twist’

I have been used to living with children and visiting children with no issues.

I’m quite a needy boy and I love getting lots of fuss and attention, I will most likely be your shadow and follow your around the house!

I am fine being left for short, reasonable periods of time.

I would love to sleep on your bed at night if possible! But if not, I’m sure with training I would get used to a new night time routine.

I am currently being fed on a raw diet.

I travel well in the car no problems, I recently took a trip in the car for a few hours to go on my holidays!

Please get in touch if you think you might be able to offer me a foster or forever home!

HEALTH

I have no health concerns but I will have a health review at the vets in due course.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I would not like to socialise with other dogs. I may need some further training in learning to pass other dogs calmly. I am muzzle trained for walking in areas where dogs are off lead. The rescue are happy to support my future family with behaviour advice and training tips.

MY IDEAL FAMILY

I would suit a typical family home who can provide me with lots of attention and mental stimulation. Preferably a home who are bull breed experienced or experienced with reactive dogs.

I have come out of my shell with team members and shown my silly goofy side! Hotdogs seem to be the ticket for being my best friend!

I am a bit of a needy and affectionate boy.

I am a lot more relaxed outside of the kennel environment and I have enjoyed playing with toys in the paddock.

The team are still learning about me but I am desperate for a home!

ABOUT FREDDIE

Hello, I’m Freddie the pocket rocket!

I love to meet new people, I can get very over-excited and boisterious with visitors, I cannot contain myself! Once I know people, I am a lot calmer generally around the home.

I am used to being left for short, reasonable periods of time – This may need to be built up as I settle into a new home.

I travel well in the car.

I can be a bit anxious if there is a loud motorbike passing me on a walk.

I haven’t had much experience with children, I am looking for a home with older children and preferably no young visitors as I can be anxious.

I know the commands sit and paw and I will take treats gently.

I am an affectionate boy looking for a 5* home!

Please reach out to my team if you can offer me a home.

HEALTH

I am due a health review when I arrive. No obvious health concerns. I am not on any medication.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I have had a lot of mixed experiences with other dogs. I can be reactive in the face of another dog.

I have been on walks with other dogs where I can walk politely next to them.

I can be different with different handlers so I am looking for a confident dog handler who can cope with varying levels of reactivity.

I have been through an awful lot, it seems humans have let me down in my young life so far. My whole body was covered in a fungal infection which was very red and sore. My team are currently getting it under contol. I am making really good progress but may require another course of steriods to help. I have been amazing in the vets and being handed has been no problem.

I was really shut down when I arrived, I spent 5 weeks in kennels with my rescue team building me up and allowing my personality to come out and shine in my own time.

Thankfully, a foster home came forward to help me! I have thrived being in a home! I have started to enjoy home comforts and engage in some play!

I walk nicely on the lead and enjoy having a good sniff of everything.

I have shown a bit of anxiety travelling in the car but I travel well once I am in.

I can be left for reasonable periods of time with no issues.

 

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am dog friendly.

HEALTH

I am currently in the middle of a health review. I may need more steriods/antibiotics soon. I am currently on some ear drops to get my ear infection under control.

MY IDEAL HOME

I would love a quiet and patient home who don’t expect too much of me as I settle. I need time to decompress so that my true personality can shine through.",09/15/2025

ABOUT LENNY

Hi, I’m Lenny!

I am a young boy who has oodles of energy! I can be super bouncy and playful when I get excited! I will definitely need to learn some manners!

I am very friendly and want to make friends with everyone!

I travel well in the car.

I will need some work on my lead walking as I can be pully, especially when other dogs are in sight as I get overstimulated quite quickly.

I am a real foodie and will do anything for a treat! I will try to steal food off the sides if you leave it there!

When I arrived, I wasn’t fully house trained but my foster home have done great work with me and I now know what to do.

Hi, I’m Lenny!

I’m a calm and quiet chilled out dude. But I love to run around the garden and play with toys!

MY HISTORY

Lola was found as a stray and taken to kennels. Sadly no-one came forward for her so she is looking for a new home through SSR.

ABOUT LOLA

Hi, I’m Lola!

I have been in kennels since December and I have had no interest.

I’m a big girl with a big personality and I would love a dog experienced home, or even better, a home that is used to larger breeds.

I have been passed around a lot in my life, I have been used for breeding and I have spent a lot of my time living outside.

Please don’t worry, I am not a banned breed and I have certifications to show that I am eligible for rehoming.

I can be quite aloof in nature and I love going on walks and having a good sniff of everything. You have my full attention if you have treats though! I will sit and paw and take treats ever so gently.

I do really enjoy my toys, I am quite active for a larger dog. my absolute favourite toy is my giggle ball! I will chase it around and roll on top of it!

I travel well in the car, in fact I love being in the car!

I get super excited when you get my lead out to go out! Currently I am strong on lead but tI have been used to wearing a halti which has helped.

Although I have been in kennels a long time, I am very happy here and I get a lot of time out and stimulation.

I have had an in-home assessment where I did struggle a lot being in a home. We would be open to a home with a kennel in the garden with full access to a garden which might make my settlement a little easier where I can come and go into the house as/when I please.

Please reach out if you can offer me a foster or forever home.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am generally quite aloof around other dogs, I have been used as a dog tester with new dogs arising in the kennels.

I may react back if a dog reacts to me and I can be a bit more on edge with smaller reactive breeds.

I am muzzle trained and I accept my muzzle very easily, but I don’t necessarily need to wear it all the time.

I cannot live with other dogs due to guarding issues that have arisen when in the presence of other dogs in a home setting.

MY IDEAL HOME

I would love a home that is dog experienced and preferably large breed experienced.

A home with patience in helping me settle as it may take some time. Full support provided to you by the team at SSR!",09/15/2025

MY HISTORY

ABOUT LULU

Hi, I’m Lulu!

I have been through a lot and I am looking for a dedicated home who can offer me a loving home and a new life!

I am a clever girl who loves to learn! I am really into food which has supported my training! Perhaps I love food a bit too much! I will steal food that is easily accessible to me!

I can be strong on the lead initially but I do get better after the inital excitement. I have really enjoyed walks out in the New Forest with my rescue team.

I already know the commands sit, paw and drop (during ball games)

I have had a home assessment with the team, and I can get very excited being back in a home! I will have some crazy zoomie moments! I really enjoy playing with toys, in particular with balls and snuffle mats/balls.

Being a working breed, I am looking for a home who can give me plenty of physical and mental stimulation. If I am not doing much, I find jobs of my own to do, but not necessarily desireable jobs, such as opening door handles or stealing things around the home!

Please reach out to my team if you can offer me a foster or forever home.

HEALTH

I am in good health. I am not on any medication.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am not recactive towards other dogs, but I can get over-excited sometimes. Some dogs may not recieve this well if they don’t match my energy.

I can be left alone for reasonable periods of time without issue.

I am not a fan of the vet, I become quite anxious and need a lot of help getting me in the door.

I am not used to travelling in the car much, so will need to have some training in getting used to this.

I can do tricks such as spin and high five in exchange for a treat! I can be a little snatchy with food sometimes.

I can be very strong on lead and will need some work on this.

Please reach out to the team if you can help me.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am not well socialised with other dogs, I will need lots of work in building up to this. I will be looking for an owner who is prepared to walk me in quieter areas initially.

Can I be rehomed with children… Over 12 years. I like all children but I can be a bit over exuberant for younger chidren.

I am looking for… A foster home

MY HISTORY

Rubble has already been in 3 homes in his life so far, due to no fault of his own. His first home rehomed him because they were due to have a baby and wanted to put him down as he was no longer wanted! His next home was a much more loving home, but sadly due to a divorce, they are no longer able to keep him. Rubble in now in a temporary third home who stepped in to help him out in his time of need.

Rubble is currently living out of our area and is looking for a home to come forward to foster him, or we would welcome applications who may be able to foster with a view to adopt. We are unable to facilitate meet and greets due to the distance until he finds a local placement with us.

ABOUT RUBBLE

Hi, I’m Rubble (got my name from TV Paw Patrol series).

I’m a typical bouncy and boisterous Staffie! I am full of energy and always happy!

I love to be around people and can be quite lively at first when visitors first come to the house, but I do settle down after a short period of time.

I enjoy lots of strokes and cuddles chilling out with/on my caregivers laps on the sofa, particularly in the evening after my walks.

I love to play ball in the garden!

I can do most of the basic commands – Sit, Lay down, Paw, No, Wait, Stay – but I am still learning about always coming when called – although I am getting better at it. I’m also learning to respond to the command “leave” and “fetch” when playing with a ball, but haven’t quite got the hang of it consistently.

I love my walks and like to say hello to as many people as possible. I particularly enjoy running around in a secure dog park where I can burn off all my energy!

I can be left for short, reasonable periods of time and I am really good travelling in the car too.

HEALTH

I am due a health check when I arrive. No obvious health concerns to address.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I am not fully socialised with other dogs. Most dogs I am happy to sniff and move on, but some dogs I can be anxious around some dogs and react. I am looking for a home who can understand this and not put me in unwanted situations.

I have made a few dog friends with slow and gentle introductions.

I generally walk well on the lead unless I get overstimulated. I will pull if I see a cat, squirrel or bird!

MY IDEAL FAMILY

I would love to finally find a forever family who are committed to me for life! I have been through too many homes already. I would suit most family set ups, in particular a home who are able to give me plenty of physical exercise and mental enrichment as I am a clever boy!

I travel well in the car and walk well on the lead.

Check back soon for more information about me!

HEALTH

I am due a health review in a few days.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

Currently under further assessments. I have not been reactive towards dogs in kennels and I have had some small interactions with another dog outside of kennels with no reactivity.

MY IDEAL FAMILY

Whilst being assessed, I am looking for an adult only home.

I would love a quiet home where I can finally relax and enjoy home comforts.",09/15/2025

MY HISTORY

Taz has been a well loved dog and has been in one home since he was a puppy. Due to unforseen circumstances, he is looking for a new home through SSR. Taz is currently residing with his owner still whilst on our waiting list to come in. We would welcome applications from those who may wish to foster him or “foster with a view to adopt”. Taz doesn’t live locally to SSR so meet and greets at not viable at this stage,

ABOUT TAZ

Hi, I’m Taz!

I’m a typical bouncy, exciteable Staffie who loves to meet new people!

I love my food and treats, I have been known to dip into the bin I love food so much! I am very gentle in taking treats though and I know the sit command and will wait patiently.

I have not lived with children but I have had some experience with visiting children. Because I can be jumpy and mouthy, I could possibly live with children aged 12+ if those children are used to being around dogs.

I am comfortable being left for up to 4 hours in my current home.

I travel well in the car, I just get a little excited in anticipation of where we are going!

My favourite toy is my ball.

Please reach out to my rescue if you can offer me a home!

HEALTH

I will have a health check when I arrive. No obvious concerns to report.

MY TEMPERAMENT WITH OTHER DOGS

I would prefer not to socialise or say hello to other dogs.

I am muzzle trained out on walks.

MY IDEAL HOME

I would love a dog experienced home committed to providing me with sufficient mental draining and physical expercise. I am a clever boy who loves to learn!

About Ralph,,https://www.blisscavalierrescue.org/dogs/available/,Sex: Male (Neutered),"Good with dogs? Yes – good with other dogs; best with calm, steady companions",Age: 2 years 6 months,,DN19 7NE,Bliss Cavalier Rescue," Location: North Lincolnshire

Basic Information
Age: 2 years 6 months
Sex: Male (Neutered)
Good with dogs? Yes – good with other dogs; best with calm, steady companions
Good with cats? Not tested
Good with children? Adult-only home
Time able to be left alone: Short periods only once fully settled
 Health & Medical Needs

 Health conditions: Chiari-like malformation–associated pain; has had patellar luxation surgery 
 On medication? Yes – prescribed pregabalin and Galliprant daily for pain management by the neurologist- Reduced adoption fee applies

 Behaviour & Personality

 Behaviour traits: Loving, people-focused, playful; sensitive to handling at times; historic resource guarding linked to pain, improving with pain relief
 Activity level: Moderate – enjoys walks, sniffing games and enrichment
 Training required: Ongoing confidence building and positive reinforcement; calm management around food/resting spaces; gentle handling for harness/collar

About Ralph

Ralph is a striking young Ruby Cavalier with a huge heart and a lot of potential. At just 2.5 years old, he’s already been through quite a journey, managing pain from Chiari-like malformation and recovering from previous knee surgery. With the right medication, Ralph has started to show the loving, cuddly and playful boy he really is.

He’s very people-focused and enjoys being close to his humans, whether that’s on a walk, playing enrichment games, or simply snoozing nearby. Ralph travels well in the car, loves his walks, and is always up for a bit of fun. 

Ralph still has moments of guarding food, socks or toys, but this has improved hugely. He will always take advantage of pinching a dropped sock or some random item, so his adopters must be one step ahead. He will need adopters who can continue with calm, positive reinforcement training and who understand the importance of giving him space when he needs it.

Ralph would suit a calm, adult-only home where he can thrive with structure and gentle handling. He gets on well with other dogs but would be happiest alongside a calm and steady companion rather than a very anxious or boisterous one.

In the right home, Ralph will reward his family with loyalty, affection, and a cheeky, playful personality. He is a very special boy who, with patience and understanding, will make a truly wonderful companion.

 Adoption Criteria

 Type of home required: Calm, adult-only home experienced with behaviour needs. Adopters must be willing to follow his pain-management plan, maintain routine, use gentle handling, and continue reward-based training. A steady canine companion could suit him well.

 Important Notes
 Adopters must have insurance or financial means to cover future medical costs.
 Home check and meet & greet required within 7-10 days of applying.
 Please read our adoption procedure before applying:

Ben,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BB3-768x1024.jpg,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/animals/ben/,1 year (approx),Male,Pomeranian mix,,GL2 7LU,Teckels,"Cutey little Ben is ready to head off to his new home. Coming to us as a stray we unfortunately do not have much information about this little chap, including whether he has lived in a home before. We would ask new adopters to make sure they have plenty of time to help him settle in and teach him all the things he needs to learn about being a good boy at home.

Ben does have a shy side initially but after a bit of time, space and plenty of treats - he soon becomes your new best friend! He would like all the humans in his new home to be over the age of 12 and would prefer to live in a calmer household with people around for good portions of the day. We do feel he has potential to be left alone for a couple of hours but this may need building up slowly. He will also need a secure garden to play in.

Ben would like to be the only pet in his new home - it would seem that he has missed out on some social skills and can find meeting new dogs a little worrying. For the most part, he walks very nicely on his lead but can be on the 'woofy' side when other dogs come too close. He has been doing some work here and has managed to  make some canine pals but would benefit from training in the future.

Ben absolutely loves a cuddle when he knows you. He will happily sit on your lap or snuggle down next to you on the sofa. He also loves his food and has already learnt to sit in the short time he has been here. Ben also enjoys playing with his toys, he loves fetch and will give you a good game of tug - o - war (we do often left him win of course, he's only 4.5 kg!).

Finally, Ben also does enjoy a brush. Being a long haired chap, Ben will need regular grooming - trims, baths and brushing. Fortunately he does quite like this but we do encourage any potential adopters to consider the time and cost this may require.

If you feel little Ben is the boy for you, please see the 'how to adopt' section of the website.

Barney,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BarneyS2-768x1024.jpg,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/animals/barney/,1.5,Male,Springer spaniel x poodle,,GL2 7LU,Teckels,"We reintroduce to you the very handsome Barney! Barney has recently found his way back into our care after his previous match didn't quite work out. Since being returned to us Barney and his handlers have been working super hard on some extra skills to make sure Barney has all the tools he needs to be a wonderful pet in his new home. Poor Barney really has been passed from pillar to post in his short life - he had more than one home before coming to us! It really is crucial that this next home is Barney's 'forever' so we encourage any potential adopter to really consider the information below before applying. Barney has so much to offer but we really need new owners to see past all those beautiful curls and teddy bear face and be able to offer the stability Barney so desperately wants.

Firstly, Barney might be one of the cleverest pooches we know! There is nothing we haven't been able to teach this dog so far. He knows sit, paw, down, stay and we have invested lots of time in helping him feel braver about all the things he used to find terrifying - this has been really quite a challenge for him but we are so impressed with the progression he has made.

Although initially a 'hands off' kinda boy, as soon as you've won his trust Barney is a super snuggler! We wouldn't go as far as a 'lap dog' but neck scratches and then flopping down on your feet to snooze is a firm favourite for Barn. Knowing that Barney can find physical touch quite scary; it's a really heart-warming moment when he asks the people he knows for fuss and who are we to say no!

Barney's best loves in life are of course, food and toys. Barney will try his best to learn anything you wish to teach him as long as there is food involved - he is very clever but we do get the suspicion he is ruled by his tummy! And then there are toys. He's not fussy, any toy and any play is the best in Barneys mind and we really see him perk up when the toy box is present. Fetch, find it, tug -o- war; you name it he'll play it! For a worried boy, it's so lovely to see him so happy to play.

As mentioned Barney can be a bit or a worrier. Due to this he is looking for a consistent home life but one that can still offer a somewhat active life style. Barney thrives of routine and consistency really helps him feel more confident because it's easier for him to work out what is expected of him. Equally, Barney is still a mix of two very clever and energetic breeds so as much as we would like his home life to be steady; he would also need a home where he can go for longer walks with lots to sniff. He would love to carry on with his training (plus anything new!) to help use up his energy constructively and will need a secure garden big enough for him to play in off lead.

It would also seem that Barney has missed out on some doggy social skills too. He does try is best to make friends but can be a little stand off-ish when he meets unknown dogs. Barney has managed to make some doggy walking friends here and would benefit from having some calm, confident walking friends once settled but would not like to share his home with any other pets.

Due to Barney finding some elements of life worrying, he would need all the humans in his new home to be over the age of 18. Experience of owning a 'doodle' type would be beneficial but our rehoming team will also be on hand to offer lots of advise and support for Barney both pre and post adoption.

What Barney needs more than anything is someone who will stick with him through the trickier bits as well as all the wonderful ones. Barney's biggest struggle is trust and we can completely understand why he feels this way. Lots of people have entered his life and disappeared and we can't explain to him that one day someone magic will come along for him and stay.

Leonard,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lenny-e1747293776570-567x1024.jpg,https://teckelsanimalsanctuaries.co.uk/animals/leonard/,3 years (approx),Male,Lurcher,,GL2 7LU,Teckels,"Leonard, affectionately known as 'Lennie', arrived at the centre as a very worried stray. Our vets have estimated him to be around 3 years old.

Since settling in and finding his paws, we are starting to see a very sweet, gentle chap who just wants to be close to his humans.

Coming to us as a stray, we do not have any history on Lennie's world before Teckels. He does seem to have some dog social skills and is particularly fond of other sighthounds, but has been able to walk with other medium - to large-sized breeds here too.

Lennie has the potential to share his home with another medium/ large dog, but can be quite vocal with his play, so would be best suited to sharing his home with a canine companion who is used to this play style.

For a bigger chap, Lennie walks nicely on his lead but doesn't seem to have received any other training. We would encourage new owners to consider taking him to treat-based training classes to not only up his skills but also help with his confidence.

Lennie loves his walks and exploring the local areas, he will also need a family who are happy and confident to walk a bigger dog.

Being a more worried boy, Lennie would prefer his family members to be 14+ and will need his new family to be around all day initially, with time left alone built up nicely and slowly.

Lennie struggled with settling when he first arrived at the centre. This has subsided over time, but we would like owners to be prepared for any potential separation anxiety behaviours that may occur during his settling-in period.

There is potential that he may be able to be left for short periods once confident in the 'being left' routine.

Lennie is a gentle giant. He adores being fussed over once he knows you, and will cuddle on the sofa all day with the staff here.

Ron arrived at the center along with his siblings as part of an accidental litter, and his owners were unable to care for them.

He may have had a tough start, but he’s not letting that hold him back.

Ron is looking for a patient, caring home where he can continue to learn and grow through positive reinforcement training and socialisation. Ron is eager to learn, and puppy classes are a great way for him to grow and build his confidence.

He is an intelligent dog and already knows lots of basic commands such as sit, down, paw and is eager to learn more.

Ron is a Shar Pei-Rottweiler mix with lots of growing ahead. Whilst we don’t know how big he will get, we do expect him to be a large boy. He may be adorable now, but he will need a committed home ready for the care and cost associated with this breed.

Whilst Ron settles into his new home, new owners will need to be around most of the day to help with house training. Once settled in, building up time left alone will need to be done gradually at his own pace.

Ron can find meeting new people and some dogs a little overwhelming at times, so he will need a patient home with sensible children 16+. He would prefer to be the only pet in the home; however, he would benefit from continued socialisation with calm, confident dogs to help build his confidence.

Ron loves going for walks but would benefit from quieter walking areas where he can continue his training to walk nicely on a lead and become more comfortable around other dogs.

Arthur came into the center along with his siblings, after his owner had an accidental litter and they were unable to care for them.  He hasn't had the easiest start in life, but this cheeky chap is ready for his own family.

He is looking for patient owners who will guide him with positive reinforcement training and socialisation. We strongly recommend puppy classes to help him continue to build his confidence and grow into a loving, well-rounded companion.

Whilst we don’t know exactly how big Arthur’s parents were, due to his breed we expect him to grow into a large, strong dog. It is easy to fall for Arthur’s wrinkly face, but it is important adopters carefully consider the long-term costs and commitment to his breed.

To help Arthur transition into his new home, he will need plenty of time with new owners at home for house training and settling in. Slowly increasing alone time will help him feel more comfortable as he adjusts.

Arthur would prefer quieter walking areas initially, where we can continue to build his confidence and experience the world.

Arthur can live with older children 16+, and adopters should keep in mind that his puppy teeth may be painful during the teething stage. Patience and training will help him through this stage.

He already knows lots of basic commands such as sit, down, paw and is eager to learn more with his family.

Arthur hasn't had many social interactions and lacks confidence; therefore will need to be the only pet in the home.

He does have walking buddies and play friends here at the center, and staff have been working with him to help build his confidence around other dogs. With slow, positive introductions, he has the potential to form positive relationships and have walking buddies and playmates with his new owners.

Despite lacking confidence, he has shown his handlers he has lots of love to give and should grow to be a loyal companion who is eager to please, especially when treats are involved.

Coming from a home environment, Max was house-trained and could be left for a couple of hours. Some refresher training and time left being gradually built up should enable Max to settle into home life once again.

Due to some unfortunate interactions with dogs that weren't his fault, Max is wary of other dogs and tends to ignore them/would rather avoid them. A pet-free home with a fully enclosed garden and quiet areas for walks would help Max to feel safe and grow in confidence.

He will benefit from continued lead work as he can be strong at times, although his training at the centre is going well. His foodie personality and desire to please should make training a rewarding process.

This clever boy enjoys snuggles with his handlers, especially bum scratches, and plays with toys nicely. He is now looking for an all-adult family with breed/ guarding breed trait experience so he can enjoy a consistent, uncomplicated life. Max needs help building his stamina whilst exercising, we feel he'd be happy in a home with a large sized garden, where he can explore around, and would more than likely be happy with the odd 30 minute walk, just to sniff along, at his own pace!

Handler Cicely says, “Despite an initial lack of confidence, it is so lovely to now see Max's waggy-tailed greetings as he bounds over to say hello. He gives the best cuddles, and now he trusts me, will snuggle up next to me in the paddock while we watch the world go by”.

Since joining us at the centre we have seen this timed, shy girlie grow into a complete snuggle monster who adores spending time with the people she knows.

Leia is really quite a worried lady who can find the big wide world quite scary. We are unsure as to how much lead training/ walks she has had in her past but the concept of going for a walk really does prove a struggle for her currently. During her stay here she has really got the hang of going to our paddocks for a run around and our home rooms for snuggles but still finds going for a walk quite challenging. Leia will need her new home to have an enclosed garden in which she can play and temporarily use as her exercise area. Her new home will need to be close to quiet walks with easy access to get there so when she is ready to venture outside, she will not be too overwhelmed. Once settled and more confident on walks we're sure Leia would enjoy expanding her walking options but for now it's all just a little too much for her. Her new owners will need to be super patient with this process and really have the time to devote to improving this. We also recommend any potential adopters consider how life will look going from a dog who requires minimal walking to one who will need more exercise as she settles.

Being a more reserved dog, Leia would like to live in a calm, only pet, adult only home with a consistent routine. She would prefer her new owners to be around for most of the day but we do feel she has potential to be left for a couple of hours if built up slowly. Leia also has some basic obedience tricks like sit, paw and down and really enjoys learning new things for tasty treats - she's super clever!

One of Leia's biggest loves in life is sofa snuggles. Being typical bull breed type she is all about the fuss, neck scratches and sofa snoozes with little regards for personal space - it's our favourite thing! Although wary of new people, once she has gotten to know you, you'll have a best friend for life.

Leia really tries her best in all that she does, we think she may have had a bit of a tricky start in life, yet she still is always trying her best to please and so trusting of the people she knows.

Pumba is such a sweet boy who loves nothing more than snuggles, his bed and humans! Perfect Pumba has come to us through no fault of his own so unfortunately we have very limited information about his background. He has managed to settle in well here and brings a perfect mix of wanting to go for long wanders with his handlers but will equally happily have as many sofa snuggles he can get! - We're not sure which one he loves more!

Pumba appears to be a somewhat laid back chap who just seems to take the world in his stride. He does lack some confidence on occasions but generally is up for most adventures big or small. We are unsure as to how much training he has received and can be a little strong on the lead at times but is working on this and making some lovely improvements. Being a sighthound we would still encourage new owners to consider the handling he may require when out and about and be confident enough to do so.

As mentioned, we do not have much history for Pumba, including whether he has lived in a home or not,  so we encourage new owners to consider the potential hurdles of settling a new dog in - housetraining, building up time left, sleeping through the night etc. Pumba will need his new family to be around for good portions of the day to help assist with this and make the transition from kennels to home as smooth as possible. Pumba would also like to be the only pet in his new home.

When Pumba is not snoozing away on his comfy bed, he does love a good play session, and being a typical lurcher, this does include a quick zoomie or two! He would therefore also need his own, enclosed garden to have a nice play in and of course, lots of toys too! Pumba also enjoys a good training session and is a clever and food motivated boy!

Pumba has the potential to live with teenage age children, depending on introductions at the centre. He would be best suited to children who are dog experienced/ savvy.

She came into the center with Missy but they have since been separated as they were finding sharing their space difficult and after different homes.

Lulu may be 14 years old, but she’s still full of life and energy! She has such a playful character and loves to chase around after toys (her favourites are tennis balls). She is looking for a fairly active family who can match her enthusiasm and provide her with lots of fun and stimulation.

She is strong on the lead and enjoys her walks, so a family with experience handling energetic dogs will be a great fit for her. Lulu can struggle to focus while out on walks and can get overwhelmed, so she is currently having some training to help her with this.

Although she does need some exercise and playtime, she will also appreciate quiet moments and loves a snuggle on a sofa, so would love a family who are around during the day to keep her company.

Lulu can get stressed in new environments and needs a calm and consistent home where she can enjoy her retirement and feel comfortable. A home with a secure garden to play in and a sofa to cuddle up on would be ideal! Lulu would prefer not to share her home with young children, older teenagers (16+) with introductions done at the center would be best.

Lulu has struggled with being in kennels so has been spending time in foster and getting on well, though her foster family are unable to keep her. We would love her to find her forever home soon so she doesn't have to spend anymore time in kennels.

While she enjoys human companionship, she’s not keen on other dogs or animals, so a pet-free home would be best.

Despite his age, he loves playing with toys and enjoys sniffing and exploring on his walks.

Brisco is an anxious boy, but seeing him grow in confidence and gain his handlers’ trust has been very rewarding as he has learned to do swapsies with his favourite toys and even snuggles up for cuddles.

Sadly, Brisco’s family could no longer care for him, but he has lived in a home environment and should only need a refresher on basic training and toilet training while he settles in. Brisco would need to be the only pet in the home while he enjoys his golden years. A quiet household with all members being 18+ would suit Brisco’s retirement plan of sofa snoozes, toys, and treats.

Although introductions may take time to build Brisco’s trust, the reward will be worthwhile as you will get to know his sweet, sometimes silly personality.

Handler Annie says, “Initially, Brisco can be worried around his toys, but the first time he swapped his favourite ball for a treat was such a special moment where I felt like he trusted me”.

Finding joy in the simple things, Moose loves playing with his toys just as much as snuggling with his handlers. Being a foodie, Moose can make friends well despite initially being shy with new people. Gaining Moose’s love and trust feels incredibly rewarding.

Moose is doing well with his lead work and picked up clicker training quickly. Even though he becomes distracted on walks, he is able to disengage and focus back on his handlers. Continued work on loose lead walking will benefit Moose, but it should be an enjoyable process as he is eager to please and loves his treats.

Due to arriving as a stray, his history is unknown. He will need a patient, gentle approach to basic training and toilet training, however, we believe he will respond well to this training, especially where treats are involved. Family members will need to be 16+ and the home will need to be pet-free.

After a difficult start in life, we look forward to seeing Moose flourish with a family who can supply him with endless love in return for lots of laughs and cuddles.

Handler Tom says, “Moose has always made me laugh when he gets excited in the paddocks and his back legs overtake his front legs”.

As some of you may have seen this poor little poppet came to us in quite the state. She was severely underweight, covered in matts and an untreated parasite left her with terrible open sores, infections and scarring. Team teckels have worked their socks off and after weeks of medications, baths, creams, lotions and potions this beautiful girl is well on the mend and ready to go home. The best thing about Polly? After all the poking and prodding we've had to do, she has not once stopped wagging her tail.

Polly is clever, snuggly, super cheeky and always makes us smile. She loves her food, playing with toys and will happily hop onto your lap for a fuss. Polly has the potential to share her home with other dogs, dog savvy, calm cats and children over the age of 12.

Coming to us as a stray we unfortunately do not have any prior information as to whether Polly has lived inside before. We would encourage new adopters to be prepared for the settling in requirements for a pooch who may never have lived indoors. Polly will need some assistance with house training, general house manners, and building up time left alone. As mentioned she is a very foody lady and came to us very underweight so might be inclined to pinch food if it is not safely stashed away from tiny Polly paws.

Polly would like her new owners to be around for good portions of the day. She generally does enjoy human company but we have also notice her display some behaviours that can be linked to the beginnings of separation anxiety. It is therefore crucial that new owners are around regularly and are able to build up any time that Polly is left slowly and at a pace she is comfortable with.

New owners will also need to be prepared to amend Polly's exercise as she continues to get healthier/ stronger. At the moment, Polly will need to be exercised in a manner that allows her to continue to heal and gain the rest of the weight she needs. However, Polly is also going to be a very clever and very active lady who will need considerably more exercise in the future than she does now.

Finally in true 'doodle' style Polly will need regular grooming including full clips as well as daily brushing. We encourage new adopters to consider the time and cost of a 'doodle' coat, especially as Polly's coat may take time to recover.

He may only be 5kg in size but what he lacks in size he certainly makes up for in personality!

Bill is a very typical toy breed, he loves fuss, attention, playing and has a nice mix of being happy to go for a shorter walk and a snooze as well as being up for an adventure!

Although initially a little shy, it doesn't take too long (and some tasty treats) before Bill is willing to be your new best bud. He would like the humans in his home to be over the age of 12 and would prefer to have them around for most of the day. Coming to us as a stray, we are unsure if Bill has ever lived in a home before so time left will ideally need to be built up as well as his new owners considering general settling in and housetraining.

Once Bill knows you, he loves being on your lap for a nice fuss and neck scratches. He also enjoys playing with toys and will even sometimes bring them back to you! It would seem that Bill has not received any basic training yet so new owners may wish to consider training classes.

Generally, Bill can walk nicely on his lead but we would guess that he has not had much experience here. He can be a little worried when on busy roads and can be vocal towards some dogs; this will require some further training once home and settled. He would benefit from further dog socialisation and ideally have the opportunity to have some regular, friendly walking buddies.

She absolutely loves toys and playing with the staff her at the centre. She does “swapsies” with toys well but again could do with some extra training around learning the basics like drop! Peggy loves her food and enjoys getting stuck into a variety of puzzle feeders and chews.

Oz is a fun-loving, clever dog with a heart full of love and a zest for life. What he wants most is to find his very own forever family, because as Oz would say, there’s no place like home.

Bright and quick to learn, Oz has already completed an IMDT training course, charming everyone along the way with his sweet nature. He’s a little wizard when it comes to picking up new skills, and he thrives on mental stimulation. He would love to continue developing his abilities, especially through puzzle games and fun training sessions with his future family.

Oz has plenty of energy and would do best in an active home with access to a spacious garden. He enjoys his walks and playtime – fetch is a particular favourite – but he feels most comfortable in quieter areas, away from busy or overwhelming environments.

With his playful personality and enthusiasm for life, Oz is sure to bring joy and laughter to his new home. His greetings may be a bit exuberant at first, but it’s all part of his excitement to be with people. Once he settles in, he becomes incredibly affectionate and loyal, proving he’s got both brains and heart in abundance. (And while you don’t need to click your heels three times to make him appear, he’ll certainly be right by your side once he feels at home.)

Oz prefers the company of adults or older families without other pets, as he likes to be the centre of attention and can find the presence of other animals a bit too much. He also isn’t comfortable being left alone for long periods – he much prefers being near his humans, soaking up all the love he can get.

If you’re looking for a smart, affectionate, and lively companion who’s ready to bring energy, fun, and a whole lot of heart into your life, Oz could be the perfect match. You won’t need to follow the yellow brick road to find him, he is ready and waiting to meet you!

Mimi is a lovable lady with a tail that never stops wagging and a heart full of affection! She adores being close to her humans – her favourite place is snuggled up in bed with you, soaking up love and giving kisses (she might even aim for your mouth!).

Mimi can be quite scared of strangers and likes to keep her distance, so her dream match is an adult-only home that can give her the gentle handling she needs. In return, she’ll be your most loyal little shadow and biggest fan.
On walks, she can find the world overwhelming, which is why she prefers quiet, peaceful strolls where she can sniff, explore, and relax…..instead of taking charge of the local neighbourhood watch in crowded spots!

Mimi isn’t keen on sharing her humans with other pets (she has a lot to say about dogs and cats!), so she’s looking for a home where she can be the only four-legged family member. She would love a secure garden where she can stretch out, sunbathe, and enjoy some safe outdoor time – all while keeping a close eye on any pigeons that dare to share her space!

Most of all, little Mimi craves your company. Being left alone is frightening for her, so she needs someone who can provide plenty of time, reassurance, and stability. In return, she’ll shower you every day with unwavering affection and devotion, plus you’ll have a permanently warm lap!

If you can offer Mimi the quiet, loving home she longs for, she will give you her whole heart — and more.

Tetley is a striking Lurcher x Husky with soulful eyes and a heart that’s just waiting to trust again. Life hasn’t always been kind to him, and because of that, he’s a little wary of the world – but with the right person, he has the potential to truly blossom. He’s looking for a quiet, adult-only home where he can take life at his own pace. Tetley thrives in calm surroundings and will need a home away from the hustle and bustle, where peaceful walks and safe places to explore are part of his daily routine. He’d love access to secure paddocks, where he can stretch his legs and enjoy some safe off-lead time in a stress-free environment.
While we don’t have much history of Tetley’s behaviour around other dogs, we do know he prefers to keep his distance and may bark when he sees them, so a home where he can enjoy space from other animals would be ideal. No cats for Tetley either, as he’s got a strong prey drive and would find feline friends a little too interesting.

Tetley is incredibly playful and has a real soft spot for toys—especially tennis balls! He loves bringing them to you and placing them carefully in your lap, hoping you’ll join in on the fun. It’s one of the ways he bonds, and it’s a joy to see. He’s also a big fan of food-based enrichment, like snuffle mats and puzzle feeders. Not only do they keep his clever mind busy, but scent work helps him feel more confident and comfortable in his surroundings. He can be a little protective over his favourite food items, which is understandable given his past. It’s more of a reflection of how precious those things feel to him, and with time, trust, and understanding, this can be gently supported. Though shy at first, Tetley does enjoy a bit of fuss—on his own terms. When he’s in the mood, he’ll come over for some affection or a good bum scratch, showing you glimpses of the loving boy he’s becoming. Tetley doesn’t like being left alone, so any time spent away from him will need to be introduced slowly and gradually. He’ll need a family who is around most of the time to help him feel secure as he settles in.

Tetley may need a little extra time, but he’s worth every moment. With patience, kindness, and a quiet home full of love, he will be a wonderful companion for someone who sees the beauty in a sensitive soul. Could you be the person to give Tetley the second chance he deserves?

Molly loves to play with her toys, especially fetch however she prefers you to chase her for the ball than her drop it. Molly loves cuddling on the sofa and having her tummy rubbed.

Dancer,/images/thumb/dog_6045_205856_10345.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Dancer came to us from the Welsh pound so we don’t have much history on him. Due to his breed and behaviour, we believe that he was used as a farm dog. When Dancer knows you he can be very affectionate and jump up for cuddles. Dancer loves to cuddle up to you on the sofa and gently nibble your fingers while getting belly rubs, if you stop stroking him he will paw at you for your attention. Dancer loves to be around you and will follow you everywhere so will need a home where he won’t be left alone for too long. One of Dancers favourite things to do is watch you make dinner in the kitchen in hopes that he could have some too! (He especially loves cheese) Dancer is an active boy who loves his long walks and exploring new places so will need an active owner and a garden of his own to run around and play freely off lead in. Dancer can get protective of his owner when on lead and can nip if anyone approaches him, because of this you will have to keep a distance from others and their dogs and walk in less populated areas. Dancer loves to play ball with you and when alone he loves to play with soft crinkly toys, you will often see him chucking them around in the air and tossing them side to side. Dancer is looking for an adult only home in a rural setting as he is noise phobic so would like a quiet home. He must be the only pet in the home. Dancer will need an understanding and patient owner as he is a very anxious boy who takes time to trust others. Dancer will need multiple visits to our centre with any potential owner to help build a bond. In time, Dancer would make a very affectionate and loyal companion. Please do consider taking Dancer home.",09/15/2025
Rocky,/images/thumb/dog_7683_160932_10436.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Rocky is a loveable boy who will need a lot of exercise and stimulation to keep him from being bored. Unfortunately, while Rocky is generally a well-behaved boy, he has shown some possessiveness around his owner which has ultimately led him to be returned. For Rocky, his ideal home would be with a single person or couple with no kids or other animals, who can give him lots of long walks and provide training to try to work on his possessiveness. If you are an experienced owner who is up for giving Rocky another chance then please pop into our New Romney branch, Weds-Sun between 11am and 3pm.",09/15/2025

He is a strong, active boy who is looking for an owner who can match this energy. He will need some training and cannot live with cats or small animals.

Buddy,/images/thumb/dog_5955_120745_8926.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Buddy was originally here as a puppy. He went to a new home for a year where he was not walked regularly and barely taken out the house. Therefore Buddy did not get the socializing he needed and developed fear aggression to any new person who entered his and his owners house, seeing them as a threat. So Buddy needs a strict one to one home with someone who has no visitors. Once Buddy knows you he is very affectionate and will bark at you for attention to lie all over you or to try the food you are eating. Buddy loves his food and treats and as he is a very slow walker and sometimes refusing to walk at all he needs a strict diet to help him maintain a healthy weight. Buddy loves his toys and will often throw them around to himself in excitement. His favourite toy is a dog friendly stick, although we have tried to give him more exciting toys he always goes back to his stick. Buddy can not live with any other dogs, cats or small animals.",09/15/2025
Stella,/images/thumb/dog_7517_134902_10323.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Stella has been with us for a little while now with no applications. While she is nervous to begin with, she comes out of her shell when she can show off just how fast she can run. Unfortunately she has not had the best start in life which has led to her being very nervous of new people, especially men, she is needing a very understanding, and patient home, with people who will teach her that people can be trusted. She can be ok with some dogs, however dislikes others, we believe she would be best suited to a home as the only pet where she can be further socialised around other animals. Due to her nerves she would not be able to live with children. If you think you have the time to help Stella learn to trust, please contact us for further information, or pop in during our opening hours.",09/15/2025

Due to this we cannot rehome her with kids. Sally is dog reactive so she will need some socialising to help with this and will need to be the only pet in the property. Sally can be nervous of new people so may need a couple of regular visits to encourage the cuddlebug we know her to be. If you think you can give this lovely girl her forever home then please pop in to our New Romney centre, during opening hours or phone 01797 366620 to discuss further.",09/15/2025
Dewey,/images/thumb/dog_7540_150424_10238.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Dewey is a very happy girl! She absolutely loves to be around people and is always wagging her tail when she sees you. She is an ex-racer so cannot be homed with cats, small furry animals and small dogs, especially fluffy ones. She has found her love of toys since being at last chance and will throw them around to herself. She will need a safe and secure garden for her to do zoomies in!",09/15/2025
Buster,/images/thumb/dog_6860_160912_9290.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Buster is a typically stubborn bulldog. He loves nothing more his big comfy bed, getting under the covers and lots of treats. He can be reluctant to walk in an any adverse weather but likes a stroll at his own pace wherever he wants to go. Buster is a nosey dog and loves coming through our office to sniff new smells and helping to feed the office fish. He will often steal staffs leads and carry his bowl to his bed where Buster can become protective over this and any long-lasting treats. He loves a butt scratch and will roll in long grass for you to scratch his tummy and can be quite affectionate on his own terms. Buster is not short on character but will need an experienced owner. He must go to a male one to one home as Buster loves men. He does not like people coming in to his home so will need to be kept separate. Buster needs a very understanding owner who will respect his boundaries and give him the time and space he needs. Please contact Edenbridge for more information.",09/15/2025
Bill,/images/thumb/dog_6087_131119_10183.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Bill is a grumpy chap at times who is set in his own ways. Despite only being 5 he acts like an old boy refusing to go on walks and wanting to sit all day in the sun. Bill absolutely loves his long red dog toy and occasionally you will walk past his kennel and see him just holding it in his mouth showing it off to the world. As cute and friendly as Bill looks, he is not a cuddly dog and couldn’t think of anything worse than being a lap dog. He would much rather get comfy and snug on the bed on the floor. He loves his own space and feels safe having an area that is just for him. Bill would love a home with someone who is happy to have him plod about in their garden and occasionally come for some attention. When Bill does want a fuss, his all time favourite is a butt scratch. He goes mad for this and loses his mind when he gets this. He will even try scratch his back on cars, bushes etc. Bill would need an adult only home ideally with 1 person or a couple who can respect his space with absolutely no children visiting. Bill is not a fan of any other animals he will avoid them when out but is not keen on having them approach him. Dogs - No Cats - No ADULT HOME",09/15/2025
Ralphie,/images/thumb/dog_5965_164231_8114.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Ralphie originally came into us after Covid as his owners thought they were getting a labrador puppy. He was being kept in a flat without a garden and had had no socialising with people. Ralphie is brilliant with other dogs and has had many friends here over the years, so he would love to have a friend in the home or a regular walking companion. When Ralphie first came into us he would get very frustrated and he would show this in mouthing and occasionally snapping, he has mostly grown out of this but needs a very kind owner to understand his behaviour and help with his training with this. Ralphie loves to run around with other dogs but also loves to chase a tennis ball so would need a secure garden where he could play freely. Ralphie does love a gentle fuss, especially a butt scratch, however he does have boundaries and will let you know when he has had enough. Ralphie loves his bed and often sleeps with all 4 legs in the air, so would love a big comfy bed in the sun to lounge in. Ralphie is muzzled trained and is also housetrained here in the kennels. Ralphie needs an experienced adult only home with no cats or small furries.",09/15/2025

She is incredibly smart and knows several tricks such as sit, down and paw. She is full of life and loves nothing better than chasing a ball and playing in water. She can get a little over excited and mouthy at times, but can be distracted with a ball, she will need lots of exercise and training to help with this. She is not keen on other dogs and will bark at those she sees on walks; she will need confidence building and socialising to help with this. Her ideal home would be an active, adult only home with no other pets and lots of tennis balls.",09/15/2025
Ian,/images/thumb/dog_7266_203800_10196.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Ian may look like a small terrier but oh boy can he bounce!!! He has very nearly cleared a 5ft fence, so the garden needs to be super secure! Ian loves making new doggie friends and has a few that he loves walking with on lead. Unfortunately Ian is not the best at making friends with people, he feels more comfortable around women and will need maybe a meet or two before he's jumping up for cuddles. Men are a different story and he is so scared of men so we are looking for an female adult only home with limited visiting men.",09/15/2025
Pinky & Perky (aka The Pigs)!,/cantweb_adminstyle/shop6gfx/dot_clear.gif,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Pinky and perky or the pigs as we all call them are not short of character! They will make you laugh everyday with their cheekiness and toddler like personality. They both love to play and would choose toys over treats. Perky loves to find the biggest cuddly toy she can and carry it around with her before ripping it up, Pinky loves all kinds of balls and will take herself off to her bed to chew on it. They both love attention and will come and sit on you for affection, perky will sit facing you breathing in your face whilst pinky will roll over for a belly scratch. Unfortunately due to not being socialised properly they take some time to get to know new people. Pinky more so than perky but once you’re in their club they are your best friends and will allow their owners to do anything with them. They can be vocal with dogs so would need to be the only dogs in the home. They cannot be homed with children, cats or any small animals. Pinky and perky are more like twins than sisters always doing things together and often copying each others movements exactly so will not be separated and have to be homed together.",09/15/2025
Jake,/images/thumb/dog_6320_200601_8596.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Sadly Jake has recently become diabetic which has caused him to lose his vision, so we are desperately looking for a foster or forever home before he loses his sight completely. He will need insulin injections twice a day but he is such a good boy and waits patiently as he knows a tasty carrot is coming. Jake is one of our long termers who is very misunderstood, he has unfortunately come from a traumatic past which has caused him to bite when feeling threatened. Once Jake trusts you and knows you he is a very affectionate boy and loves a cuddle on the sofa. He is very good with other dogs socially but has to be only dog at home due to resource guarding. Jake is obsessed with food and will do anything to get hold of it so being a typical beagle he will try his very best to get what he wants. Looking for an adult home only who understands Jake's needs.",09/15/2025
Kimi,/images/thumb/dog_6373_122732_10179.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Kimi sadly came to us severely overweight and was nicknamed the barrel. She was struggling to walk and after further investigation it was discovered, she unfortunately has luxating patella in both her knees. Due to Kimi being energetic she jumps around in her kennel, bouncing off the walls, making the recovery post-surgery not possible, so she is kept comfortable with medication and is doing well on it. Since finding her love for walks and balls she has managed to shed the weight but is still in need of shedding those last few kilos. Kimi is absolutely obsessed with her toys and mainly balls. You will always find her with a ball in her mouth, whether she is out on a walk or laying in her bed she will have a toy. She treats it as a comfort blanket and wherever she goes, a toy will go with her. Kimi is great with the people she knows however it can take time to build up trust with her. Kimi does enjoy a fuss and some attention but only on her terms and only for a short period. Kimi is happiest being near and with you rather than on you like a lap dog. Kimi likes her own space, but likes to know you are around, so would prefer to sit in her bed surrounded by her toys with you in her eyesight so she knows she is not alone. One of Kimi’s rare features which we all love, if she allows you to sneak a glance is her ‘pig skin pads on her paws. Kimi is looking for an experienced adult only home with no other pets. Kimi needs an owner who will give her the time and patience she will need to earn your trust and to settle in to a home environment.",09/15/2025
Wicky Whacker,/images/thumb/dog_7396_171054_10204.jpg,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Wicky is an ex-racing greyhound so is looking for his forever retirement home. Wicky always gets VERY excited to go on his walks and jumps around in circles until he is out walking, where he then walks to heel on the lead unless he sees something small and furry. He is muzzled trained and we would recommend him wearing this around smaller dogs as he has only ever been around dogs of his size. Wicky is always full of beans and is not short on character, he loves everyone he meets and is a firm volunteer favourite here always wagging his tail which whips everyone in the legs. He also loves his toys, the squeakier the better, he will play with himself in his kennel until he has tired himself out where he would love a big comfy bed to lounge in the sun in.",09/15/2025

Gunner is a typical Spaniel who loves to play ball and can play for hours. He will always find a ball when on walks and when playing fetch he will always bring the ball to your feet. Even though Gunner is a happy chap and is always wagging his tail, he is not keen on being over-fussed and likes his own space.",09/15/2025
Tito,/cantweb_adminstyle/shop6gfx/dot_clear.gif,https://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.co.uk/kennel/dog.php,,,,,TN8 5NH,Last Chance Animal Rescue,"Hello I am Tito. I am a very loving dog, with the people I trust. I arrived at the New Romney rescue many years ago from a Welsh pound, no one knows my early previous history, but from my behaviour and the marks on my body, my friends at Last chance know I wasn't treated very nicely. Sometimes I can get anxious and see hands as a threat, I also struggle being out of my routine. One staff member says she is blessed to have my trust, I snuggle up for a fuss, offer her cuddles, demand a tummy tickle (poking my feet in her face) and enjoy her company on walks and in my kennel, but I admit, I do get jealous if anyone else is around us - even when I like the other people! I do get nervous around new people and situations, which sometimes means I can be a bit snappy. I am told I'm handsome and also super fit for my age, I can jump onto the picnic tables in our grounds in just one leap. I will run around the grounds chasing the wild rabbits and squirrels, but birds are my real nemesis, if only I could climb trees!!! I also love sunbathing on the grass and playing catch with my big ball, but I prefer the right company over treats and games and don't like to be left on my own. I am definitely not keen on walks in the rain or the cold! Due to my past experiences (and from the information my friends at Last Chance have gathered on my previous adoptions), I'm told I need a very special and experienced, single, adult only home, with no other animals, I may prefer a female human. Once I form a strong bond with you and feel safe, I will become your best friend, but this also means I will not want to share you, I have waited so long for you I want you all to myself!! I need a quiet home, with a secure garden, very rare visitors and definitely no children visiting! It would be best if you have a very structured routine that I could fit in to. I will need multiple visits from any potential adopter, so we can get used to each other. If you think I could be your best friend please speak to the staff at New Romney Tel: 01797 366620, or pop in to the centre during our opening times: Wed-Sun 11am-3pm. I have been at New Romney for a very long time, please consider me. Love Tito x",09/15/2025

He needs a lot of physical and mental stimulation. He can be very vocal in the house and on walks so needs a rural home with little distractions. Once he is calm, he can be very cuddly on the sofa and playful. He loves to play with toys, especially balls, the squeakier the better!! He had a very high prey drive so we advise keeping him on the lead. He must be the only dog with no other animals in the home. He needs an adult only home with someone used to bouncy dogs. Mallow will make a wonderful companion to someone who has the time and patience to put into his training and care.",09/15/2025

Adopt or Foster Maggie & Kaya,https://k9-rescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Maggie-Kaya-header.jpg,https://k9-rescue.org/portfolio-items/adopt-maggie-kaya/?portfolioCats=17%2C455,Approx 11 yrs old (born 2012-2013),Both Female – spayed,,Crymych,,K9 Rescue,"Maggie and Kaya are two adorable bonded female seniors, who have lived together their whole lives, and are therefore looking for a forever home together.

Born 2012-2013 they are both currently 11 years old, and although incredibly fit and healthy (on walks people guess their age as 3-4 years), finding a home for two dogs of this age together is an impossible dream, so they are available for both adoption or fostering under our Forever Foster Initiative, where we pay all of their food and medical bills; all the family have to do is provide a loving forever home, and cherish them and cuddle them for us!

They are both cuddle monsters; Kaya is full on ‘cuddle me’, whereas Maggie is a bit more reserved, and will give a subtle paw tap to ask for a tummy rub.  They love to have an occasional game of chase or spar fight, and are very good natured whilst playing. They both love their walks out and about, they walk nicely on a lead and are very social with strangers, admired by all who meet them out on their walks, and they particularly adore treat time!  Inside the home, they settle nicely, are fully house-trained and enjoy snoozing on a comfy sofa or in a plush basket.

These adorable girls are very social and polite, yet could do with some off-lead training before being allowed to run free – we totally believe in force-free training and love Tamar Geller‘s Loved Dog Method of teaching so highly recommend her books and podcasts for training.

Background
Maggie and Kaya were both originally found separately as abandoned youngsters in Bulgaria, yet were adopted into the same home in 2013 where they had lived together ever since.  Through no fault of their own, their family circumstances suddenly changed and so were returned to our sanctuary in West Wales under our Full Rescue Back Up For Life scheme.",09/15/2025
Adopt Eric,https://k9-rescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eric-header2.jpg,https://k9-rescue.org/portfolio-items/adopt-eric/?portfolioCats=17%2C455,5+ yrs old (born October 2018),Male,,Crymych,,K9 Rescue,"Eric is a loving and affectionate 6 year old male dog for adoption, who is looking for his very own safe haven with a loving family where he can feel secure and cherished.

Eric adores people and simply craves cuddles and affection.  He has a timid nature, so can be uncertain on walks, needing some help with confidence building as he often seeks reassurance, yet he loves his walks in the countryside with his brother Ernie who he relies on for confidence – with further patient guidance and understanding from his new family, he will easily blossom into the vibrant, gregarious spirit he’s meant to be!

This kind and incredibly joyful little boy brims with affection and loyalty, he walks nicely on the lead, is great meeting people and dogs out on his walks, and with his love of people he has great recall, although with his timid nature, he can be easily startled, so off-lead walks should be limited to very safe, quiet places, close to home, that he has already got to know very well over a period of time.

Eric is a sweet, gentle soul, whose heart is full of love, so can suit living with dog savvy kids.  He needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Eric becomes much more confident when he is with another dog, as on his own he finds it difficult to cope outside of his safe surroundings, so a home with another dog is a must for Eric, either his new family will have an existing resident dog, or they adopt Eric together with his brother.

In summary, Eric is a really adorable, good natured dog, who, with just a little bit of nurturing, will absolutely flourish with a new loving family.

Background
All of our dogs have lived their whole lives in family groups in an open space, kennel free environment and it is therefore a shock for them to leave all that they know. For this reason, we require Eric’s new family to either have an existing resident dog if introductions go well, or adopt Eric together with another dog.",09/15/2025
Adopt Ariel,https://k9-rescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ariel-cover.jpg,https://k9-rescue.org/portfolio-items/adopt-ariel/?portfolioCats=17%2C455,5 yrs old (born January 2019),Female – spayed,,Crymych,,K9 Rescue,"Ariel is a sweet and affectionate female 5 year old dog for adoption, who is looking for her loving active family.

Ariel is an active youngster who loves her walks in the countryside and loves to play and bounce around – she adores being around people, Ariel is very gentle so can suit living with dog savvy kids and another dog if introductions go well. She needs a home in a peaceful setting away from busy towns or cities with access to a garden and would enjoy company for most of the day. Ariel settles nicely and travels well in the car, and loves to go out for walks – she’s a brisk walker so will definitely help her Guardian get their steps in!  She is very affectionate and loves to cuddle with people she knows, yet she is still nervous of new people and situations, so will need a few visits to get to know her new family.

Ariel still needs some work with her recall as when off lead she gets so focused on what she is doing, she becomes ‘deaf’ to being called, yet when she does finally hear us, she becomes super excited and apologetic as if saying ‘ohh, were you calling me?!’  so off-lead training is and will be a must for her, as although people oriented, she is easily distracted.  She loves to play with other dogs, often inviting play with a bow and cheeky bouncing.

In summary, Ariel is a really delightful, good all round dog, who, with just a little bit of training, will absolutely blossom with a new loving family.

The world can be a little overwhelming when you’re young like me. I’m still very young, and everything is so big and new — so I take things slowly, one paw at a time.

Since arriving here, I’ve been a quiet, gentle soul. I don’t really know what this “lead” thing is all about yet, and I get a bit confused when someone puts one on me — but the good news is, I love cuddles. That’s my happy place. Curling up in your arms, leaning into you for comfort, and soaking up a belly rub or two? That’s where I feel safe. That’s where I come alive.

The lovely people here say I’m starting to come out of my shell. I’ve even begun to show a playful side! When I’m outside in the play pen, something clicks — I run, I chase, and for a moment, the world isn’t so scary. It’s joyful. And I think, with the right person, I could feel that way all the time.

I’m looking for a calm, patient home where someone will understand that I need time and love to build my confidence. If you go slow with me and show me the world can be kind, I promise to give you all the love in my little body in return.

I might be able to live with another friendly dog, and possibly older children (13+) who understand I need gentleness and space while I grow braver.

If you have a quiet home, a kind heart, and room on your lap for a soft, snuggly boy like me, then I think we could be something really special",09/15/2025

I’m always thrilled to see you (honestly, tail-wagging, full-body-wiggle thrilled!). I absolutely love attention and fuss – in fact, I might even try and climb on your lap for a cuddle. I know I’m not exactly lap-sized… but I promise I’ll try to fit!

I walk beautifully on the lead and I really enjoy getting out for walks and little adventures. Sniffing, strolling, and exploring the world with you? Yes, please! But I’m just as happy relaxing by your side and soaking up all the love you have to give.

I could possibly live with another chilled-out dog like me, and i could possibly live in a home with older children (aged 13+).

Life is just SO exciting — there’s always something to chase, a toy to squeak, or a ball to zoom after. Honestly, I could play all day if you let me!

I’d absolutely love an active home with humans who enjoy adventures as much as I do. Long walks, games in the garden, or fun training sessions? Count me in! I’m still learning the ropes when it comes to manners and grown-up dog stuff, so I’ll need a patient owner who can help guide me with kindness, consistency, and lots of praise (and treats — can’t forget those!). It’s clear though that I haven’t seen much of the world. I can be a little unsure when it comes to being near roads and traffic so the team at Stray Aid have been very caring and introducing me to these experiences at a slow pace and trying to get me desensitised to these things.

But hey, it’s not all go-go-go with me. Once I’ve burned off some steam, I’m the biggest cuddle bug you’ll ever meet. I’ll happily clamber onto your lap for snuggles, ear scratches, and some one-on-one fuss time. Honestly, I’m a total softie deep down.

I might be able to live with another dog, especially one who doesn’t mind my bouncy personality and can show me the ropes. But for now, I’d do best in a home without young children — I’ve still got a bit of growing up to do, and I want to make sure I learn how to be the best version of myself!

I’m a gentle soul with a heart full of love and long legs made for lounging! I’m a typical lurcher — calm, well-mannered, and the king of comfort. If there’s a soft blanket or a cosy bed around, you can bet I’ve already found it.

I like to take life at my own pace — no need to rush! I’m easy-going and relaxed, and I’ve been told I walk beautifully on the lead. In fact, just the sound of you picking it up is enough to get my tail wagging and my feet ready for a nice stroll. Walks are one of my favourite parts of the day — not too fast, not too slow — just a lovely wander by your side.

I may not be the life of the party (yet!), but I’ve started to show some interest in playtime. Toys are still a bit of a mystery to me, but I’d love an understanding human who can help me figure them out. Who knows? Maybe I’ll become a toy enthusiast with a little encouragement and patience!

I absolutely love a bit of fuss and attention. Give me a good stroke and I’ll melt into you with my classic “lurcher lean” — it’s kind of my signature move. I’m friendly, affectionate, and always up for a cuddle with my favourite people.

I could possibly live with another calm dog friend and I could possibly live in a home with older children (13+), especially if they understand that I like a peaceful, gentle environment.

So if you’re looking for a calm, loving companion who will walk by your side, relax by your feet, and lean in for cuddles every chance I get — I might just be your perfect match.",09/15/2025

I also LOVE being out and about. Walks? Yes please! Exploring new places? Even better! I’ve got energy to burn and a playful streak too — chasing after balls and carrying around my teddies is my idea of a good time. And don’t get me started on treats… I’ve got a fantastic nose and a real talent for sniffing them out!

That’s why enrichment games with tasty rewards are a big hit with me — they keep my clever brain busy and make me one very happy dog.

Buddy Male Lurcher,https://cdn.waggytails.org.uk/content/uploads/2021/08/Buddy-11-225x300.jpg,https://waggytails.org.uk/dogs/,,,,,BH21 3AW,Waggy Tails Rescue,"Buddy Male Lurcher
Buddy is a 4 year old Lurcher.
Buddy has now been in a foster home for a few weeks.  His foster parents report “Buddy is an affectionate loving Lurcher and puts people at ease with his playful nature. Whether he’s lounging in a sunny spot or trotting alongside his favourite humans on a walk, he brings warmth and joy wherever he goes. Loving cuddles, soft blankets and playing with his toys in the garden, he’ll become part of the family very quickly.”

When Buddy first came in to us, he was very nervous and distrusting of humans. Over time, Buddy has become a very friendly and playful boy. He very much enjoys his one-to-one time and is learning how to show affection in his own special way!

He loves nothing more than a speedy sprint around our field and will happily play fetch with a football or tennis ball until he is tired out. Treats are also a favourite of his.

Buddy is good and attentive when out on a walk and walks nicely on a lead. Owing to his lack of socialisation when younger, he can be a bit vocal when he sees other dogs out on a walk, but with further input and more socialisation this can be addressed.

As a Lurcher, Buddy has a very strong prey drive and is interested by small wildlife when out walking and small pets in the house. Therefore, Buddy would be suited to a house where he is the only dog without other pets or animals.

Meet Ringo, a delightful 11 ½ old Labrador Collie cross with the heart of a puppy and the charm of a true gentleman. Ringo brings joy to everyone he meets—his affectionate cuddles, playful energy, and lovable personality never fail to make us smile.

Despite his age, Ringo is full of life and loves nothing more than spending time with people. He wants to be friends with everyone and everything, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He’s a big fan of other dogs too, though he can get quite excited when meeting them and is always eager to say hello.

Ringo is currently on a weight loss journey and has already lost 5kg—he’s doing brilliantly but still has a bit more to go to reach a healthier weight. He’ll need an owner who can keep him on track and support his continued progress.

He’s strong on the lead and does pull, so he’ll need someone confident and steady to handle him on walks. That said, he’s incredibly rewarding to be around, and his love for toys and youthful spirit make him a joy to have by your side.

Ringo may be in his golden years, but he’s truly young at heart and ready to share his love with a family who can offer him the care, companionship, and continued support he deserves.…read more

Meet Magnus, a strikingly handsome German Shepherd with a heart of gold and a sweet, affectionate personality. Magnus absolutely thrives on human attention—he loves nothing more than being close to people and will happily try to become everyone’s best friend. He’s even a star at the vet, taking everything in his stride with charm.

Magnus is super intelligent and full of potential, but he’s also a strong boy who will benefit from ongoing training and socialisation to help him channel his energy in the right way. He’s especially enthusiastic when he sees other dogs—he means well but can get a bit overexcited, so he’s still learning how to stay calm in those moments.

His playful side really shines when he’s out in the field, where he happily chases his beloved penguin toy or a football with joy and enthusiasm. To keep him happy and fulfilled, Magnus will need a home that can offer plenty of enrichment, structure, and love.

With the right guidance, Magnus will be an incredibly loyal and rewarding companion.

French Bulldog

4 years old

Bea has been under the care of one of our senior vets due to issues with a very sensitive tummy

Now receiving the right diet and supplements, Bea has blossomed and her tummy issues have resolved

Her adopter must be willing to carry on with the regime which is extremely easy going forward

She’s very sweet with people and will make a lovely companion for someone who likes to be left alone on walks and just enjoys the company of their dog

Bea is now spayed and vaccinated and her health is flourishing

Support will be offered by the rescue for life

A great little character but must have someone with knowledge of brachycephalic breeds for her safety and well being

Yorkies approx 6-7 years old

We have decided to try and find these lovely sweet girls a home together as they have been through so much and Doris really relies on Dot for her courage

Both are small- Dot weighs 2.5kg and Doris is under 4kg so someone used to tiny breeds a plus point

Both are now spayed and vaccinated and are looking for a loving, local home where they can experience a home life for the first time in their lives

They must have an adopter who is at home most of the time to help them bond and get used to being handled

Doris is particularly skittish and afraid of people and will need a steady approach to training and time patience and routine to get her used to being handled, she is so desperate to be loved but lacks the confidence to relax until she has built up a lot of trust

A safe secure home and garden a must due to their nervousness, and an adopter with a quiet lifestyle willing to put in the commitment required to be their saviour and show them how good life can be

No small children

Pointer cross 2 years old

Luke has been returned to the rescue after 8 months in his first home, after becoming over protective of his family.
There may have been subtle signs of this happening, that were missed,  and allowed him to continue making his own mind up which led to this.  He is a such a young friendly boy, we are hopeful an experienced adopter will see his potential, and offer him a good life with no children,  or a too busy household with lots of comings and going’s,  as he will be better with adopters that have time and commitment and can show leadership and kindness.

He will relish a steady approach to training and knowing what’s expected of him and he will make a faithful companion

Support from the rescue,  including offer of behaviourist trainer to recognise any signs to work on will be provided

Very worthwhile

Chihuahua cross Chinese crested & Chihuahua

2-3 years old

This bonded pair of little dogs have been through so much together and have formed a great friendship here at the rescue
They both have ‘issues’ like being frightened of people…

They must have a very understanding home, a quiet lifestyle, someone with compassion, time and patience

Please don’t apply if you are looking for a ready made sociable dog, as they need a home where it’s all about what you can do for them

They are both wonderful little characters but will bond with one person to the detriment of all others..

Ideally a single lady who doesn’t have a busy social life,  and just wants to give something back for the love and devotion of these two little characters.

Very worthwhile

Both from sad pasts",09/15/2025

Hey guys, Bobbie here!

I originally arrived at Oakwood back in Janurary 2021. When I first arrived I was very scared due to how mistreated I was in Romania. It took me a while to begin to trust people again but I managed to find a home in March 2021. 

In the home I was very loved and the last 14 months I was there I made lots of progress in so many ways. Sadly, I have now come back to Oakwood due to compatibility issues with my family. I am an incredibly loyal boy and tend to bond strongly with one person. For this reason I would prefer a 1 person household that I can give all my love and attention to. The humans said they understand what a huge ask this is though so they will also be happy to look at a 2 person household too, it just may take me a little longer for me to feel safe with meeting 2 new people at the same time. Unfortunately I can really struggle with new people and introductions need to be very slow so that I feel safe - but I promise that I will be the bravest boy and do my absolute best as I really do want nothing more than to meet my forever family.

Once I trust you, I guarentee that you will have a best friend for life.  My ideal home would have minimal visitors.

I'm a lazy boy who enjoys snoozing in my comfy beds, don't let that fool you though because I am super clever really! I enjoy enrichment and love my snuffle & lick mats. I also really enjoy obedience and trick training and it seems to entertain the humans when I show off all the cool tricks I know. I also love a blast on our big field, especially with my girlfriend Alex <3",09/15/2025

Ralph's Story:

Our handsome boy Ralph, where do we start with his story..

Ralph was rescued back in March 2021 from a kill shelter in Romania. He was adopted shortly afterwards but was returned 12 days later. Ralph was a very nervous boy and he needed time to settle in and feel safe, something that he sadly he was not given.

Shortly afterwards, he was offered a place at a different rescue as they believed that he'd be snapped up quickly and this would give us a space to rescue another dog that was facing euthanasia.

Unfortunately, Ralph was overlooked time and time again and spent a very long time at this other rescue. They decided to give him another chance elsewhere and knew he'd thrive in a different environment with lots of new dogs to play with.

Ralph became very attached to the staff and started being a bit naughty with the other dogs, warning them off and not letting them near his human friends. This behaviour started getting worse and so Ralph came back to Oakwood to see if he could reset himself and start enjoying being around dogs again. So far, he has made lots of dog friends that he loves spending his days with but we don't interact with him whilst he is with them just to prevent any previous issues from arising.

Ralph will be staying with us for the foreseeable future and we will actively be looking for the best retirement home for him.

Ralph has never had his own home and family before which is just heart breaking so we need to make sure we find the perfect forever home for him. Could this be you?

Introducing... Maudie! 

Maudie's Story:

Maudie came to us after spending a long time living in a public kill shelter in Romania. 

She was a very timid girl that - until arriving at Oakwood - had received next to no positive interactions with humans. 

She now has the confidence to ask the staff, and most of the volunteers, for strokes. She absolutely loves her fusses but she can take a little time to trust strangers enough to allow them to stroke her too.

Maudie is looking for a quiet home, with a patient owner and we believe that she will absolutely thrive in a home environment with lots of 1-1 time which is what she's currently craving.

Introducing... Shep! 

Shep's Story:

Shep is approximately 5years old and has sadly not known much of life apart from the horrors of living in a public kill shelter in Romania.

He is a very sweet boy and you can see in his eyes just how much he is trying to be brave and wanting to make friends with us all at Oakwood.

He has got so much potential and will hopefully thrive in a home with lots of consistency and 1 on 1 time with his forever family.

Carrie's Story:

Are you looking for a new best friend? Then look no further than Carrie!

Carrie has recently arrived with us at Oakwood and with her sweet personality and kind nature, we are hoping she is not going to be with us too long before she finds her forever home.

We were contacted about Carrie as she was being held in shelter in Romania where she was getting picked on by the other dogs. She is a large girl and so was in with lots of other large dogs, but this gentle girl wanted nothing more than to be out of that enclosure and to be with the volunteers that showed her kindness.

We were told that the volunteers had spent a couple of hours with Carrie and when it was time to go back into the enclosure, she was shaking and holding on to them, pleading with her eyes, to not be put back. We were told that she was not coping at all and she is one of the dogs were they would expect to one day be notified that she had been attacked and didn't survive :(

We couldn't let this gentle soul stay there any longer and agreed to accept her into our care.

Carrie is very human and dog friendly but can be very nervous until she gets to know you. She is very scared of the world around her and is not yet ablet to walk on a collar and lead due to fear. She loves playing with dogs, loves her food, and is starting to copy the other dogs and play with toys <3

Adele's Story:

Adele is just 11 months old and has spent her whole life living in shelters in Romania and at Oakwood Dog Rescue.

We had a plea from a volunteer rescuer that had just been at the shelter stating that there were 2 pups there that were completely withdrawing into themselves and were starting to shut down. They were very worried that these 2 babies wouldn't survive the winter as they were already so frail, and temperatures had already dropped to -5 degrees. It usually gets to -20 during their winter months.

In the photos, Adele is attached to Beyonce's side. Over time though, these 2 girls have made many new friends and are no longer reliant on each other. They both now kennel share with different dogs and are settled and happy with their groups. Unfortunately, when letting them back together for play dates, it seems that these 2 have really grown apart and no longer enjoy spending time with each other.

Adele has never lived in a home before and so would require time, patience, understanding and lots of positive based training to help her learn the ropes of home life.

Beyonce has now started enjoying strokes from staff and some volunteers and we are so proud of her for this. With time and understanding, Beyonce is going to thrive in a home of her own.

Beyonce has never lived in a house before and so will require time, patience, understanding and lots of positive based training to help her learn the ropes of home life.

Introducing... Rusty! 

Are you looking for a fluffy ball of fun? Then Rusty may just be the dog for you!!

Rusty's Story:

Rusty is approximately 8 years old and has sadly spent around half of his life living in a public kill shelter in Romania. He arrived in the UK November 2023.

About Rusty:

Rusty was very scared upon his arrival at Oakwood and he quickly showed us that he was not enjoying the company of other dogs so we moved him to be on his own. This is when his personality really started to show and this goofy little fluff ball appeared, started asking for fusses and making us laugh as he'd bound up and down the corridor with a big grin on his face. 

Rusty was adopted back in November 2024 but was sadly returned after just 4 weeks. Unfortunately, this really affected him and he was depressed for weeks, it was just heart breaking to see.

Rusty's cheeky personality has slowly started to shine back through but he's not quite the same dog as he was when he left us for his new home.

He is more nervous of us, flinching at every move we make, even when we are as slow as possible and showing him exactly what we are doing.

He used to be a dream on the lead with no reactivity to dogs or traffic, these days he can be reactive to dogs and some traffic he's not phased by, but randomly a certain vehicle will terrify him and he's throw himself to the ground and panic. Rusty is very food orientated so he can be snapped out of this but we are trying so hard to get the old Rusty back that we once knew.

Rusty needs someone with patience and understanding and we hope that the loveable goofball that we know is hiding in there somewhere, will gleam back through once he realises again that he is safe again and there is nothing to worry about.",09/15/2025

Prince's Story:

Prince is a timid soul that was rescued from the horror's of a Romanian shelter.

He was shut down in the shelter and just too scared to do anything. If the shelter volunteers needed to do anything with him, they said he'd just completely freeze, let them do what they needed, and then run off back to a cold corner of the concrete pen he was living in, and try and make himself small and invisible.

Prince is not yet ready to accept strokes but from him watching the other dogs interact with us, he seems like he's really close to trying it.",09/15/2025

Charlie's Story:

Charlie is a small boy that was really struggling in the shelter in Romania.

Upon arriving at Oakwood, he was very skinny and straight away showed signs of food guarding from the other dogs.

Dogs really have to fight for survival in the shelters as they are fed minimal amounts of food which is just tossed into the pens. For this reason, Charlie has learnt to guard any food from other dogs and this is the reason he is still alive.

Charlie has also shown signs of food guarding from people too as we went to move an empty food dish so any children in the home must ensure Charlie has his own space anytime food is around and to not go near him as sadly, this would likely not end well.

Any children living in the home must be very sensible and not put Charlie into a position where he feels he will need to guard.

Chester is a very timid boy that doesn't yet have any trust at all with people. He is going to need a calm and patient home with lots of love, time and understanding.

In many ways, Peppa is the perfect dog  – she is quiet and undemanding, loves her food, she doesn’t bark and shows no signs of aggression; she loves other dogs – large and small – and is most comfortable in their company, therefore we are looking for a home for Peppa where she can be with another dog.  Peppa loves the outdoors, and trots along beautifully on the lead.
Peppa’s new owner will need to be patient and understanding: she is a nervous girl, easily startled, and given the chance, she will try to run off.  She is small, fast and agile and will need a garden that is absolutely secure and owners who are vigilant in closing doors and gates.  Peppa will take some time to settle and get used to new people, because of this we are looking for an adult only home with limited visitors for Peppa.
If you are looking for a dog to cuddle, you’ll need to be patient, perhaps for many months.  She will follow you around, but will shy away from outstretched hands and cuddles, and run from you if she feels crowded – her new owner will understand this and wait patiently for the moment when she is comfortable enough to snuggle up, and it will happen!
Peppa is a delightful little dog with so much to give, but the rewards of taking her into your home will come later. Please do not be swayed by her cuteness and her amazing story, which touched us all, but do please contact us if you can provide the very special home that Peppa’s needs.

Luna,https://warringtonanimalwelfare.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG-20250906-WA0000.jpg?itok=7xwiV6iy,https://warringtonanimalwelfare.org.uk/luna-11,Age: 14 months old (Sept 2025),Gender: Female,Breed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier,,WA1 1NA,Warrington Animal Welfare,"Luna is a sweet nature and a big heart. She came into our care after her previous owner, sadly, became too unwell to look after her. Now, she’s ready to find a loving forever home where she can continue to grow in confidence.

Luna absolutely loves human company. She enjoys her walks and, although she can pull for the first few seconds, she soon settles and trots along happily (sometimes in a little zigzag pattern – she’s still perfecting her lead manners!). Out in the world, she takes everything in her stride – traffic, wildlife, and even busy walks don’t phase her.

She has previously lived with dogs and seems comfortable around them, but she hasn’t lived with cats. Luna has also lived with a child around 11 years old, so she may suit a family home with older children.

Playtime is one of her favourite things, especially when a ball is involved. Her recall can sometimes take a back seat when she’s having fun, so adopters could help her practice in an enclosed field.

In the kennels, Luna does find being left alone a bit worrying and may howl if she feels lonely, so she’ll need a home where she isn’t left for long periods to begin with. She can also be startled by loud noises, but with time, love, and reassurance she’ll grow more confident.

The best thing about Luna? She’s a gentle, affectionate girl who wants nothing more than to be by your side, enjoying cuddles, walks, and adventures.

If you’re looking for a loyal companion who’ll bring joy and love into your life, Luna could be the one for you. 

Please don't leave her waiting, apply today!

He walks okay on lead but can pull to get to interesting things. He knows basic commands and has some recall. Loves to play ball or throw and catch his toys and enjoys a snooze on the sofa.

Obie gets on fine with most dogs, though he's happier with those smaller than him.

He travels in the car and can be left for a few hours.

Penn,images/dogs/2217.jpg,https://heathlands.org.uk/dog.php?id=744,- 4 years,Male,- Border Collie type,,SG8 7ED,Heathlands Animal Sanctuary,"Penn is a loving dog who enjoys company & attention from his people. He does like to bury his head into your body for a stroke and loves to roll on his back for a tummy rub. He is already an excellent family dog, and with a little more nurturing on walks and jumping up to greet people or when he is excited. He can be a little boisterous on occasion but rarely barks and is quite relaxed in his foster home.

He's very good in the home, loves the garden, where he runs up and down with his squeaky ball, which is favourite toy. He's crate trained for nighttime, travels well in the car & has been taken on holiday in the UK by his foster home, where he had a lovely time exploring lots of new walks.

Penn is quite strong on lead, he can be both traffic & dog reactive on lead, which in his case, means lunging at passing cars, cyclists, scooters etc in particular so this will need more work. He has lived with other dogs in foster before, so we believe he would be fine with a female dog already in the home, pending successful meeting.

He will need an experienced, adult household, who are willing to put in the time to train him and provide plenty of exercise and stimulation. Penn is a very bright boy, he just needs the right environment to help him shine.

He's generally fine with other dogs but seems to prefer females. He enjoys his food and treats and hasn't shown any signs of allergies or food intolerances.

He can be a bit strong on the lead at the start of a walk but loves his play time with toys in the paddock and soon calms down after a run.

Arnie would be best suited with older teenage children as he is a big boy and doesn't realise his size.

Molly *Updated*,images/dogs/2429.jpg,https://heathlands.org.uk/dog.php?id=772,- 3 years,Female,- Miniature Daschund,,SG8 7ED,Heathlands Animal Sanctuary,"We are now happy to say that Molly can live with a male dog, that will give her a bit of time and space initially while she gets to know him. We think this could help with her confidence.

The difficulty is, she won't make friends with other dogs instantly, it took her about a week to stop baring her teeth at the other dog in the foster home and a few weeks on, they're now besties!


If you're looking for a little velcro dog then Molly is the one for you! She is a typical clingy dachshund who forms a strong bond with her owner/s and wants to be with them ALL the time.

Molly is a tiny 5kg and is currently fed a raw diet which she's doing very well on.

She is a little poppet and a total lap dog who just wants to have cuddles, belly rubs and all your attention. She is learning to play with toys and enjoys chasing a ball.

Molly lacks confidence and is looking for a patient and understanding, adult only home with people who will get her out and doing things, to help her realise the world outside isn't as scary as she thinks.

She will bark at people entering the home and is quite wary of new people and other dogs when out walking, this is being worked on while she's in foster and she's making great progress.

Molly also needs some lead work as she will mostly only walk in one direction (straight forwards) and doesn't like being redirected! Like most darling daxies she can be a bit stubborn!

She can be left for short periods of time but when you get back she will be SO excited to see you that she will do a little excited wee and will then jump and run about because she's so happy. She gets the zoomies and dances about when it's time for bed.

Molly would love a home where she can be with someone most of the time.

She is incredibly intelligent, quick and keen to learn. Training classes and mental stimulation will be essential.

Skylar would enjoy living with another playful dog or having regular contact with one.

These pups have a double coat so will moult continually. They want to be close to their humans and will be vocal if they can't see you. They are all very Samoyed in temperament.

Sammie the Tripawd,images/dogs/2456.jpg,https://heathlands.org.uk/dog.php?id=788,- 9 years,Female,- Small/medium mixed breed,,SG8 7ED,Heathlands Animal Sanctuary,"Sammie is a truly remarkable lady who has been through so much & yet is the most friendly, happy, waggy & affectionate, cheeky darling, with a real spring in her hop!

When we first heard about Sammie, she was in a dog pound with one of her back legs hanging uselessly. A very kind lady was able to get her out & sent her straight to a vet clinic, where it was discovered that she was an older lady, who also had some mammary tumours & bad teeth. After some xrays to find her leg had been badly crushed years ago & scans to check the cancer hadn't spread, she had her first surgery, which was the leg amputation & neutering. Following a month of recovery, she had her second surgery, a double mammary strip & dental. She stayed at the clinic for 4 months in total, until she was fit enough to travel.

Since arriving with her foster, nearly 2 months ago now, she has made fantastic progress with rehabilitation. Sammie needed to lose some weight, gain back her balance, flexibility & muscle tone. She is now down to 14.5kg & with the help of a fantastic physiotherapist from Baldock, Jennifer Lucas, is looking much more comfortable as she's hopping along.

Sammie is very friendly with people, loves a stroke & a gentle cuddle. She politely meets other dogs on lead & shares her foster home with 2 or 3 but in an ideal world, she would like her very own human to adore & be adored by.

This extra special lady, will need an extra special home. She can manage steps in & out of the home but shouldn't attempt stairs. She will need either carpeted flooring indoors or rugs & runners on hard flooring so she's less likely to slip & fall.

Sammie wants to be as independent as possible but she does need help into & out of the car & someone who is able to get on the floor with her & pick her up if needed. She is limited to 10 to 15 minutes of exercise, twice a day, due to damage & arthritis in her front legs but it's really important that she does keep moving & keep her weight down. The speed she can reach hopping up the garden with her foster sister is impressive!

It's hard to put into words, the strength of spirit this lady has. She survived for years, with the pain of a useless, crushed leg & other associated injuries, probably from being hit by a car. Yet she's been incredibly trusting of vets & other strangers, allowing all handling, without complaint. She's grabbed her second chance at life with all 3 paws & wants to enjoy every minute, whether it's chasing up the garden, relaxing in the shade while her human works in the garden or snoozing in a comfy bed in front of the tv.

Sadly after 6 years he has had to come back to us due to his adopters’ ill health.

He is a little overweight but as he’s now getting plenty of exercise we are sure this will help him get trimmer.

We were told he has not been around children and not lived with other dogs.

He has had no issues since being back with us and loves his walks and cuddles.

Pip would possibly suit someone on their own who wants a companion but happy to let him potter around and enjoy his walks

It does appear he likes plenty of attention but on his terms and will let you know when he has had enough with a nip.

We have not experienced this within the kennel environment but do have information from his previous homes.",09/15/2025

HOPE,/slir/w500-h394-c500.394/webroot/uploads/Hope%20A%20web.jpg,https://stokenchurchdogrescue.org.uk/dogs/hope653,Age : 4 years old (approx.),Female,Pocket Bully Mix,,HP14 3TD,Stokenchurch Dog Rescue,"CLICK HERE FOR OUR PRE-ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE

Most of you know Hope and her story by now, for those who don’t here is her story. She arrived to us through a member of the public who found her on the side of a road and upon arrival it was clear she was in early stages of labour, later that day she was rushed to the vets for an emergency C-section. Although 4 pups were delivered only 1 had survived, later to be known as baby Brian. Hope was a fabulous mum to him, and he eventually flew the nest, and it was now time to focus on getting Hope better. We managed to get her skin looking healthier and she even had BOAS surgery to help her be able to breath, which she has now fully recovered from, so finally she is ready to have her happily ever after in a loving home.

 

Personality – Best way to describe Hope would be, incredibly friendly and loving to all that thrives on fuss but “a bull in a China shop”, this girl has no sense of her weight and strength, often knocking and jumping into you or anything in close space, meaning your legs and fragile items will not be safe. She doesn’t purposely mean any harm but the impact from her does hurt (she will not be suited to anyone with mobility problems). Her personality is just that of a goofy, crazy and nuts character that never fails to make us laugh.

 

Exercise & Training – Coming in as a stray we are unaware if Hope has ever lived in a home, this will mean new owners will need to expect putting all basic training, including toilet training. Although she has had BOAS surgery to help her breath better, its still recommended that her exercise times are kept short and sweet. New owners will need to be extra cautious in warmer climates. To help keep her out of boredom we recommend focusing more on mental enrichment.

 

Other Animals – We have tested Hope around a few different dogs, overall, she isn’t bad but not great either. She does better with calmer dogs, but we wouldn’t trust her off lead with them. When tested with dogs who are more excitable, she can become reactive to them, and the same out on walks if there is a reactive dog she will likely react back however if they remain calm, she still may stare but she will quickly lose interest and carry on walking. We will be looking for a pet free home.

 

Type of Home/ Owner Experience – We do feel Hope would be best in a quiet environment as she does become noise sensitive and it does work her up. We will also be looking for a home that has access to an enclosed garden with at least 5ft fencing. Hope will require someone who has owned a bully breed before or has a good amount of knowledge about the breed.

 

Hope really is fabulous character to have the pleasure of looking after, if you didn’t know her story you wouldn’t believe what she has been through as she has just been so forgiving, and she does put a smile on everybody’s face that she meets, having the true ability to make your day a lot brighter.

ABOUT OCEAN

In March 2025, Ocean was found by a member of the public and taken to SDR in very bad shape.  She was emaciated, had infected wounds, and suffered from severe hypothermia. Thanks to the care she received at Crossroads Veterinary Centre, as well as the ongoing love and support from the team at SDR, Ocean made a full recovery and now she is unrecognisable from the sad, emaciated dog she once was. 

 

WHAT’S GREAT ABOUT OCEAN?
Super affectionate once she trusts you and loves cuddles
Enjoys interacting with her handlers
Loves going out for walks and adventures
Muzzle trained
Good at the vets
Enjoys training and enrichment which helps her confidence

 

WHAT OCEAN NEEDS…
Owners experienced with Bull Breeds
Patient owners that will allow her to settle in at her own pace
Secure garden
Owners who are prepared to put in some work with her reactivity
Continue her crate training and provide a safe space for her

Rally was originally signed over to SDR in January 2024 after a sudeen change in her owners circumstances.  We knew she wouldn't be with us long as she is a wonderful girl who is very well trained and was adopted less than a month later.  Sadly due to her owner becoming unwell, Rally was return in March this year.  Having not been exercised due to her owners illness, Rally had piled on the pounds.  She has lost a whopping 10kg since being back with us and is almost at her target weight.

Knight arrived as a stray after a member of the public found him in the woods; scared and emaciated.  Knight did his 'stray time' with the local pound and then came back to us.  It took a while to build him back up to a healthy weight and now you wouldn't recognise him as the same dog.

Travels well in a vehicle
Incredibly food motivated, which is great for further training

Loki joined us after a conflict arose with a female dog in his previous home. We’ve found him to be a very loving, excitable and bouncy boy, but is very much a people dog rather than a dog’s dog!

Peach arrived at SDR via another rescue.  She hasn't had the best luck being found as a stray originally. She didn't have any history but was clear from the start she has a strong working instinct to herd, even if it's her own kind. After spending six months at another rescue in Birmingham she was sadly overlooked but hopefully she will have more luck in finding her home here in the countryside - we hope that a change of audience will help Peach find the home she truly deserved.

Beautiful & gorgeous are words banded around when people meet Joules, and don’t get me wrong she most certainly is.  The only other words missing are bonkers, crazy and bouncy.  As anyone who has owned a boxer type before will no doubt testify.  This lovable breed are in a league of their own when it comes to full on madness.  Joules came to us as she was a little too much for her previous family.  She has lived with children and was well mannered, if somewhat excitable when around them.

Eddie was handed in to SDR back in 2022 after the owner’s realised Eddie wasn't suited to city life, living in the outskirts of London.  Eddie being a livestock guardian breed, a working dog that needs a specific environment and very experienced owners or it will not work out.  He went out on home-trial to live on a farm which very much suited him; however, during the trial there were a few teething issues, the main one being that although they had the ideal environment, he didn't suit their lifestyle due to how territorial he could be on their property towards strangers.

Brie was handed into SDR back in 2022 as her owner couldn’t cope with her care alongside her daughter's needs.  She suffered from fur patches missing from her coat which sometimes bled and were very itchy.

Oscar came to SDR when a family member developed allergies to his fur which resulted in asthma.


Oscar has settled in well to the routine here at SDR and is happy to see the dog carers for a good fuss and a cuddle. One thing he doesn't like is being left, he can become a little vocally demanding until you come back for more cuddles. He does however settle in time and relaxes on his bed.

Food & Treats - Oscar is a bit of a chunky lad, so at present, he is fed on a weight-control biscuit. He does like his food but does not bolt it down, he is well-mannered when taking treats but can sometimes be a little bit pushy, wanting more.

People & Personality - Oscar can be a little shy when he first meets someone new, but this very quickly passes (particularly if treats are involved) and before you know it, he's your new best friend. He has a fabulous personality which comes shining through the more time you spend with him.

Traveling & Vets - Whilst here at SDR Oscar has been on a short journey to see our vets, He was a little unsettled in the van and did whine while on the journey. Having arrived at the vet he was quite well-behaved to start with the vet and assistant giving him a fuss. Unfortunately, when the vets wanted to examine him, he wasn't quite as happy, he did growl at the vet when they tried to listen to his heart and check his teeth. We did muzzle him for the examination, but this made matters a little worse, with Oscar trying to pull the muzzle off. When the examination was all finished Oscar went back to his happy self with the vet giving him a fuss.

Out & About - Oscar does like to go for a walk, he gets rather excited when having his harness fitted. Once out he does tend to pull somewhat on the lead and being the size he is, you certainly know about it. He loves to take in all that's around him having a good sniff of the fauna and flora. He is not fazed by passing traffic and happily carries on enjoying his surroundings.

Dogs & Cats - Oscar is very vocal when meeting new dogs and because of his size, some dogs find him quite intimidating. Oscar couldn't live with another dog, but he could (in time) have some canine buddies to go walking with. Introductions would have to be done gradually and well controlled. We have also introduced Oscar to our resident cat and again he was very vocal when he caught sight of her. Our Resident cat (Clove) is very used to meeting dogs and was not concerned about his barking, choosing to bop Oscar on the nose, just to let him know who's boss.

Garden & Fencing - Oscar is most certainly going to need a garden, we have found that he does not like to toilet on concrete and prefers to go on grass. He will need a good-sized garden for him to have a play and run around and a 6-foot secure fence.

Oscar's new family - Oscar is looking for a new family that can keep up with his high demands for entertaining him. He can be left for up to four hours, but this will need to be built up gradually and he will need to be let out to the toilet just before you leave and as soon as you arrive back home. Oscar loves his walks so his new family will also need plenty of energy to keep up with him. 

Oscar will require a minimum of two visits from all members of the household ahead of the adoption process.


The adoption fee for Oscar is £250.00

He needs time to get used to other dogs and can be reactive to them so ideally he should be homed as an only dog. He is really smart and a quick learner. He is very good on the lead but the outside world and busy places he doesn’t know can make him anxious. For that reason he has been trained to wear a muzzle and he is happily wearing it on walks - for his own safety he needs to be muzzled when outside as if he is tressed by something he can be unpredictable. He would thrive in a home in the countryside where he has a big garden to run (he loves to spend time in the garden), rather than going for walks in busy places. He would also love to have an active human as a companion he could go and run with in quiet environments or play with as he has so much energy. He is however able to relax and play with toys by himself and chill at your feet. He is super affectionate, he loves people and belly rubs and can get excited meeting new people as he just craves attention and wants to be loved by everyone. He has been trained to go for car rides, we can’t say he is particularly enjoying the car, but he is happily going for car rides with you and has no issue travelling. He is not fond of cats and will only be homed with children over 10.",09/15/2025

Della has sadly found herself in need of a new home after her owner was no longer able to care for her.

She is a little overwhelmed at the moment with kennel life and we are still getting to know her but she seems really sweet natured and loves the company of people.  Her previous owner said that she is really affectionate, bouncy and playful once she fully trusts you and relaxes 

We are still assessing her suitability to live with another dog as she has only previously had minimal interactions with other dogs when out on walks.

She can be quite vocal when she sees other dogs when out and when she’s excited or frustrated in general, she likes to tell everyone about it!  

She is a large girl who can be quite strong on a lead and will need someone who will be able to manage her physically.  This is something that can be worked on once she has a good bond with someone

She has never lived with children and due to her nervous nature, we would only look to place her in a home with dog savvy children over 12 years.

She is untested with cats and small animals.

Meet this little cutie, Zeus 

Zeus is a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier cross 

Sadly, Zeus wasn’t getting along with the other dog in the home and he is now looking for a home as an only dog.

When out walking he isn’t reactive towards other dogs, he just doesn’t like it when dogs are in his personal space.

He can be a little timid at first when meeting new people, but a little bit of time and patience and he is soon cuddling up on your knee asking for strokes 

Due to his shy nature, we would look to place him with children 12+ years.

He cannot live with cats or small animals.

Meet Able 
His life so far has been fairly sheltered and he hasn’t yet had much chance to discover the outside world.
As a result, he is a little nervous with new people, environments and experiences but he is eager to learn and is proving to be very sweet natured, affectionate boy. And although his confidence is currently holding him back a little, we feel it will only be a matter of time before he begins to relax and enjoy being a puppy. 
Able has started to go out for walks now and is taking everything in his stride 
We feel he would benefit from a home with another dog that would help him grown in confidence and show him that the world isn’t such a scary place.
He will need an understanding home that can offer him the time, patience, training and care that he needs to become a well rounded dog. 
Able may be able to live with older, dog savvy children 10+ years.
He is untested with cats but this is something we can assess.

Harper was adopted from us back in 2021 but has sadly had to be returned to us due to not getting along with the other dog in the house. 

He is a large crossbreed who originally came across from Romania as a puppy.

He is a loveable character who will make a wonderful companion in the right home. 

He walks really well on a lead but he does have the size and strength to pull towards something of interest so he will need someone who can manage him.

Whilst being here, he has passed some dogs happily with no reaction at all but has taken a disliking to others. We will be looking to place him as an only dog.

He has been friendly with everyone he has met so far whilst being with us, but he can be a little bit timid of new people to begin with when he first meets them.  We were told by his previous owners that he was ok with older visiting children but he has never lived with children so we are looking to place him in an adult only home.

He cannot be rehomed with small animals or cats.

If you think you can offer Harper a loving home then please call us on 01430 423986 any day between 11am -2pm.

He is a lively, friendly chap who is full of enthusiasm for life.  He will need an active home with someone experienced who can give him the time, consistency and training to help him become a well rounded, adolescent dog.

Storm is a 9 month old Saluki who is seeking a new home through no fault of his own. At his tender age, he has already been passed through two homes already and non of this is through any issues caused by poor Storm.

He was a little insecure when he first arrived with us but he is coming out of his shell beautifully and beginning to love learning about what life and people have to offer him.

Storm did live briefly with two small dogs and although he wasn’t a problem, he was a little too boisterous for them.

We would love to find this wonderful boy his secure future where he can learn to bond and settle into a new life.

Storm does like other dogs and he may benefit from another well balanced dog to help him learn the ways of the world – We would look to conduct meet and greets with a suitable match with a view to potentially rehoming him with another dog.

We are looking for an experienced , confident home for him where he can seek assurances to help him contnue to grow in confidence.

We would not look to place him in a home with children as he would suit a calmer home and routine, with less hustle and bustle.

He is not suitable to live with cats or small furries.

If you live within the East Riding , Hull and surrounding areas and feel that this stunning boy could be the next addition to your family, please call us between 11-2pm any day, on 01430 423986.

Poor Polly found herself in the stray kennels and in need of a new home 

She is a 5 year old, Large Labrador Cross who needs someone who can give her some time and understanding to feel secure.

Polly is still under assessment but has been generally friendly with people she has met so far. She can be a little wary initially of some people so she will require a home with previous dog experience.

She also loves her time in our off lead paddock and is beginning to show her playful side, and her love of balls 

As she has an unknown history, we cannot rehome her with resident or visiting young children. A home with dog savvy children of teenage years and upwards would be considered.

Whilst in our care she has shown that she is not comfortable around other dogs at the moment – As such we would be looking to place her in a home without any other dogs.

If you feel that you can provide Polly with an experienced and loving home where she can gain confidence and feel secure, we would love to hear from you.

Please give us a call between 11-2pm any day, on 01430 423986 for further information.

Ralph is a French Bulldog of around 5 years old.

He came into our care with an untreated leg injury which rended the leg unuseable and it was also causing him severe discomfort 

This leg has now been removed and the difference in Ralph is amazing to see. Every day as he heals, he becomes happier and more at ease with himself, and life which shows just how much pain he must have been in before 

The time is now right for Ralph to find his forever home…..

We are looking for a child and pet free home for Ralph where he can re-adjust, gain his confidence and settle into a new home.

He can take a little getting used to new people, but once he likes and trusts you – he soon grows to love you. Ralph is also walking nicely with other calm dogs from the shelter.

Ralph is starting to enjoy a potter about now and is learning to enjoy his new found, pain free mobility – what we now need, is someone for him to love.

If you can give this special boy his chance at his brighter future, please call us between 11-2pm any day, on 01430 423986.

Winston is a large crossbreed who is sadly looking for a new home due to a change in the owners circumstances.

He is a friendly lad who loves a run around our offlead paddock and a good bum scratch 

Winston is a strong boy so he would need someone who can physically manage him but during his time here, we have introduced walking aids that make him much easier to manage and a pleasure to walk.

Winston does walk well alongside other dogs here at the shelter, however he doesn’t appreciate dogs in his personal space so we are looking to home him as the only dog in the home.

We are looking for a pet and child free home for him where someone is at home most of the time.

If you have room for a large bundle of love in the shape of our Winston, please give us a call for more information.

Poor Gizmo came into our care as he had been abandoned in a property:-(

He is a hound dog ( No pun intended :-)) of medium size and around 1 1/2 years old. He is a friendly boy who is loving having his freedom and being out and about, living his almost bestest life ……

All we need now is for someone to come and fall in love with him and give him the life that he deserves.

As he has an unknown past and he can be quite a bouncy lad who requires some time, patience and understanding, we cannot rehome him with children.

We feel he may be better suited to living with another dog and therefore we are looking to place him in a home with another dog rather than as an only pet.  This will of course be subject to the right match and successful meet and greets. This may also help him to settle and gain some confidence.

He is untested with cats.

We are looking for an active home for Gizmo, where someone is at home for a good proportion of the time and ideally with previous hound experience, or an understanding of their breed traits.

Gizmo has a history of abandonment and some of his behaviours reflect this – He will need a home who won’t give up on him, and will work with him so that he can overcome his fear of being left.

Please give us a call between 11-2pm any day, on 01430 423986 if you can give this lovely young boy his new beginning.

Hi, I’m Miley! 🐾
Your future best friend, sofa snuggler, and part-time goofball!
I’m a happy-go-lucky girl with a big heart and an even bigger personality. I absolutely love to play – give me a squeaky toy, a game of chase, or just a good old-fashioned zoomie session, and I’m in my element! But don’t worry – once I’ve had my fun, I’m all about the chill life. I can snore the day away on a comfy sofa like a true professional.
I adore people and think everyone I meet is my new best friend. Seriously, I’ll say hello to everyone – tail wagging, goofy grin, the whole package! I’m also very happy to share slobbery kisses, especially with little humans (as long as they’re 5 or older and don’t mind a bit of drool).
I might be able to live with another dog, but we’d need to meet first at the centre to make sure we get along. I really enjoy going on walks with doggy pals, even if we don’t live together, I’m quite the social butterfly. Cats? Never lived with them before, and I think I’d prefer to keep it that way. I can be left home alone for a couple of hours once I’ve settled in, but I really do love company. I’m just a big softie who wants to be near my people, whether we’re playing, walking, or snoozing, but I will just carry on my nap if you do need to pop out.
If you’re looking for a lovable, loyal, slightly silly best friend who will fill your home with love (and maybe a little bit of drool), then I might just be your girl. I can’t wait to find my forever home — could it be with you? If you think so, click the link below to apply for me

Love and tail wags,

Hi, my name’s Otis and I’m a 4-year-old Chihuahua. I’m on the lookout for my forever home, and I hope it might be with you.
I’m a big softie at heart – my absolute favorite thing in the whole world is cuddling up on the sofa with someone who loves me. I promise to make the best snuggle buddy you’ve ever had.

I’d like to be the only pet in the house, because I really enjoy having all the attention to myself. I could have some doggy friends to go walking with, though you should know I can be a bit noisy at first when meeting new pals – I just need someone patient who can help me settle.

If you’ve got children, I’d be happy to live with those aged 11 and up, as long as they’ve had some experience around dogs.
A secure garden with at least 4ft fences would be perfect for me to have safe zoomies. Once I feel comfortable in my new home, I’d be okay being left alone for 2–4 hours.
I can’t wait to find a family who’ll let me curl up next to them, keep them company, and make their days brighter with my love. Could that be you? 💛

If you think you have the perfect home for me please Apply below, look forward to seeing you! lots of love and licks, Otis xxx

Chester ,,https://www.jerrygreendogs.org.uk/dogs/chester/,7 years 11 months,Male,French Bulldog,,NG21 0PG,Jerry Green Dog Rescue,"About me

Hello everyone, my name is Chester 🐾💙

I’m a handsome 7-year-old French Bulldog with a big personality and an even bigger heart. I’ve had lots of love in my life, but now I’m on the lookout for my perfect forever home where I can really settle down and be someone’s loyal best friend.

I’m a gentle soul who adores human company. My favourite thing is to be close by your side, whether that’s snuggled up on the sofa, following you around the house, or pottering about the garden while you keep me company. I promise to make you smile with my silly expressions and my cheeky ways.

Here’s what I’m looking for in my forever home:

🏡 A calm, adult-only home where I can relax and feel safe – children really aren’t my thing!
🐾 To be the only pet so I can soak up all the cuddles, attention, and treats just for me.
🕒 Someone home most of the time who can help me gently build up my leaving hours.
💕 A loving family who enjoys cuddles, companionship, and having a loyal little shadow.

If you’re looking for a sweet, affectionate companion who just wants to share life’s simple pleasures with you, then I think we could be the perfect match.

I can’t wait to meet my new family and start this next chapter of my life. Could that be with you? ❤️

Love,
Chester 🐶✨

🐾 Hi, my name’s Oscar 🐾
I’m a 6-year-old Labrador with a big personality and even bigger energy! I’m playful, bouncy, and strong – life’s just too exciting to sit still for long. I’m looking for an active forever home where I can share my love of fun (and cuddles too, once I’ve worn myself out!).

Here’s a little more about me:
I could live with children aged 11+ who don’t mind my enthusiasm and bouncy nature.
I’m house trained and can be left for up to 4 hours once I’ve settled in.
I get along with other dogs when I’m out on walks, but I’d like to be the only pet at home so I can have all the attention.
I’ll need a secure garden with 6ft fences to play and burn off some of my energy.

If you’re looking for a fun-loving, loyal companion who’ll keep you smiling and moving, then I might just be your perfect match. 💛

Hello, my name’s Toby. I’m a small Poodle X looking for a new home where I can feel safe and understood.

I came into rescue through no fault of my own. My coat was in a very poor state and heavily matted, but after a much-needed groom I’m looking a lot smarter. Because of that experience, I do find grooming and handling worrying, and some areas of my body are still sensitive. I’ll need patient, confident owners who can help me slowly build trust and show me that these things don’t have to be scary.

I would like to be the only dog in the home, as I don’t enjoy sharing my toys or space. I may enjoy having walking buddies once I feel secure, but I prefer not to live with another dog. I can be protective over my belongings, so experience with resource guarding would be very useful.

I will need a home with extremely low leaving hours, as I get upset if left alone. I’m not suitable to live with children, but a calm adult-only home with a secure garden would suit me best.

I wouldn’t be suitable for first-time owners, but in the right hands he’ll be a rewarding companion. If you have the time, patience, and experience to help me with my quirks, I could be the cheeky companion you are looking for!

💎 Hi, I’m Sapphire! 💎

I’m a 2-year-old Rottweiler and I’m looking for my forever family! Don’t let my big size fool you – I’m a total softie at heart. I’m house trained, full of personality, and I promise to bring both love and laughter into your life.

I can live with children aged 7+ as long as they’ve had experience with big dogs like me – after all, I’m basically a cuddly bear in a dog suit! 🐻 I can be left for up to 4 hours once I’ve settled in, but I’d really love to know my people will come back for snuggles and playtime.

I’m dog friendly and enjoy meeting canine pals on walks, but at home I’d prefer to be the only pet so I can have all the fuss and attention to myself. I’ll also need a secure garden with 6ft fences to keep me safe while I zoom around and show off my silly side.

I would prefer to not be left on my own for long in the beginning and I should be comfortable to be left for to 2-4 hours once I’ve settled in.

I’m looking for a forever home where I can share all my love and energy. Are you looking for a loyal, funny, and adorable companion who’s always ready for the next big adventure? I’m your guy!

Hello, I’m Hugo! I’m a puppy with a heart full of curiosity and a tail that can’t stop wagging. I’ve got a sense of humour that keeps everyone laughing, and an energy level that could power a small city. I’m very smart and can quickly learn new tricks; I know several commands already and I’ve cracked all the usual ones. While I’m waiting for my forever family to come along, my fosterer has already taught me a few new things and if you look at my videos, you’ll see that I’ve learnt ‘touch’ and ‘spin’ now too! I picked them up in no time and now I’m looking for new tricks to master! If you can think of more to teach me, I’m ready and eager to learn!

I’m a puppy, so I just LOVE playtime, but I do enjoy a snooze here and there too. I’m always excited to meet new people, and I’ve never met a person I didn’t like. I’m an active and energetic lad, so if you’re looking for a companion who’s always up for an adventure, who’ll keep you laughing, and who’ll give you all the puppy kisses you could ever want, then I’m your guy. I can’t wait to find my forever home. Apply to adopt me, and let’s start our adventure together!

I am looking for a home in a quiet, not built-up area, ideally something semi-rural or rural, due to my reactions to traffic and other dogs. I will need an active, experienced owner who is willing to carry on my training and development, and I can live with children 14+, pending successful introductions through the Meet & Match process. I would love to be the centre of your world as the only pet in the home, and I ideally would need a home with someone that has experience with German Shepherds and know all our funny traits. If you would like to know a bit more about me first, please contact the East Yorkshire team on 01430 449112 or eyorks@jerrygreendogs.org.uk. Lots of love, Hugo xx

Hi, I’m Cooper! I’m an 7-year-old Bichon Frise looking for my forever sofa (and forever person). I can be shy at first, but once we’re friends, cuddles are my absolute favourite thing. We will have to meet here at the centre a number of times to help build my confidence.

🐕 Out and About
I love my walks and enjoy politely greeting other dogs, but I’d prefer to be the only pet at home. I walk nicely and like to explore at a steady pace. I might be 8 years old but I sure do enjoy going out on walks and am still looking for an active home.

⏱ Being Left Alone
Once I’ve settled, I’m fine to be left for 1–2 hours. I’ll likely snooze until you’re back. I do however prefer you to be around!

🏡 My Ideal Home
Due to my nervousness, I will need a calm, adult-only home. I’ll need a secure garden with 5ft fencing so I can potter around safely. I would prefer a family who do not have lots of visitors to the home as this does make me quite worried.

✨ What I’m Looking For
A patient, kind human who’ll let me build my confidence at my own pace. If you’ve got a comfy sofa and plenty of love to give, I’ll be your loyal cuddle buddy for life. If I sound like the little lamb you’ve been looking, please fill out an application form or get in touch with my friends at the Nottinghamshire centre on 01623 792 886 or email on notts@jerrygreendogs.org.uk

Hello there, my name is Beatrice – but you can call me Bee 🐝.
I’m a 6-and-a-half-year-old cross with a heart as big as my paws and a dream as simple as a soft sofa to call my very own.
I’m a super friendly, super sweet girl with lovely manners. I can walk well on the lead but I still need to find a family that are confident with large breeds!
I don’t ask for much – just a peaceful, cosy spot in a calm home where I can snooze, snuggle, and be someone’s best friend. I’ve heard people call me the sweetest, gentlest soul they’ve ever met… and honestly? I think they might be right.
In my foster home, I recently proved what a perfect companion I am – I slept peacefully on my bed all night without moving a muscle.
I’m not one for sharing my house with other dogs or cats – I prefer my own space. I’m not too keen on small fluffy things and I have a habit of chasing squirrels away! On walks, I don’t mind doggy friends!
I’d be happiest in a home with older children (11+) and a secure garden with a 6ft fence would be perfect for my potters and sunbathing sessions – I like to feel safe while I’m exploring.
Right now, I think I would cope with being left for up to 2 hours, with the hope this could be built up once I’ve found my feet.
If you’ve got a sofa, a kind heart, and a biscuit or two (okay, maybe three…), I could be your perfect match. I’m waiting patiently – tail wagging, big eyes hopeful!
With love and sloppy kisses,
Bee 🐾

Hi, I’m Troy — an almost 3 year old ex-racing greyhound looking for my forever home! I’m a gentle guy with lots of love to give, but I’ll need a family who understands what life after racing looks like. I’ve never lived in a home before, so everything is new to me . I’ll need time, patience, and support to settle into this big, unfamiliar world.

Because I’m still learning about life off the track, I’ll need a little help with things like toilet training, getting used to being left alone, and keeping my nose off the kitchen counters (I’ve got a tall snoot and a curious mind!). A calm, consistent routine will really help me find my paws.

I’ll need a fully secure garden with fencing at least 6ft high, where I can safely stretch my legs. I’ll need someone who is home most of the time at first — I find comfort in company and will need help building up confidence being on my own. I can’t live with small animals or cats — they’re just too tempting — and I’d be best with children aged 11 or older who are respectful and calm. I might be able to live with another sighthound, but we’d need to meet and make sure we get along.

I’m muzzle trained, which is very typical for my breed, especially when out and about. It’s nothing to worry about — just part of our safety routine as ex-racers. If you’ve had experience with greyhounds like me before, that would be amazing.

I’m ready to trade in the track for a sofa and someone to love me for who I am. If you think you could be my new best friend, I’d really love to meet you.

Hi there – I’m James, and I’m ready to start my next big adventure! 🐾

I’m a 5-year-old greyhound, tall, elegant, and full of charm (if I do say so myself). I used to be a racer-fast legs, quick turns, the whole package-but those days are behind me now. These days, I’m all about comfy beds, gentle walks, and stretching out like a noodle in the sun.

I’m looking for a special home-somewhere calm, safe, and full of love. I’d be happiest with a secure garden with 6ft fences where I can zoom now and then before heading back inside for a snooze.

I would need to be the only dog in the home but I could share my walks with other similar sized dogs. I do enjoy having a play with other dogs but I don’t have the stamina for long play sessions. with my racing background, I do have a prey drive, so homes with small dogs, cats, or other little furries are a no-go for me.

I love people and would love to live with a family, children over 8 years old would be ideal as I haven’t met small humans before. I’m polite and friendly when I meet other dogs out on walks, and I walk nicely on the lead too. I love to go on adventures, I’m such a good boy when I travel and will lay down on the back seat and have a snooze.

If you’ve got a spot on your sofa, a secure garden, and a big heart, I could be the long-legged best friend you’ve been waiting for. Could you be my forever family?

Love,
James 🖤

Hello. My name’s Louie, I’m a 3-year-old ex-racing greyhound, and while I may have had a speedy past, these days I’m all about the sofa life. Seriously — if you’ve got a comfy couch, we’re halfway to being best friends.

🐕 Out and About
I love people and will happily follow you around for cuddles and company. I am dog social and enjoy making new friends, I’m not going to be climbing mountains or going for long runs, it’s not my style, I would much rather a gentle stroll and a spot of people watching. I am a gentle boy and walk lovely on the lead.

⏱ Being Left Alone
I can manage being left for a couple of hours, but I haven’t lived in a home before so it will take me a little while to get used to everything. I much prefer to be the only dog in the home as I do not like to share my things!

🏡 My Ideal Home
I could live with dog-savvy kids aged 7 and up — I would like a calm home where I can stretch out and relax. A garden would be amazing! I don’t need tons of space, but having somewhere to potter and sunbathe would make my day. My garden would definitely need 6ft fences to keep me safe! I’m not a fan of cats or small furries though, so I need a home without those little guys as I can’t resist but chase!

💕 What I’m Looking For
I am looking for a patient home who can help me settle in and show me all the home comforts. If you’re looking for a loyal, loving shadow with long legs and an even longer nap schedule, I might just be the hound for you.

Hello there, I’m Buster! Don’t let my age fool you, I’m still a spry old chap with a heart full of youth. I’m as friendly as they come, always ready with a wagging tail and a playful spirit. I’m sweet too, I love giving affection (sometimes a little too much!) and receiving it in return, so I would be best suited to a home with children 14+ I’ve got years of experience in being a loyal companion and I promise to bring a lot of happiness and fun into your life. I can be left comfortably 2-4 hours just leave me a cozy bed and a football, and I’m golden. I should mention, other dogs? Really aren’t my thing, I do prefer to have my humans all to myself, so I would prefer to be the only pet in the home. Adopting me means gaining a forever friend who’ll always be there to cheer you up with my playful antics and sweet nature. I’m ready to make your life a whole lot brighter!

I’m a big, gentle German Shepherd–Labrador mix with an even bigger heart. At three years old, I’ve got a lovely balance of playful energy and calm companionship. I’m the kind of dog who’ll stick by your side and be your best friend through everything.

I’m a real softy — affectionate, loyal, and incredibly people-friendly. I absolutely love being around my humans, whether it’s for a cuddle on the sofa or a fun walk with my favourite ball (yes, I like to carry it around like a treasure!). I’m housetrained, well-mannered, and eager to please — especially if you’ve got treats!

I already know some basics like “sit” and “wait,” and I walk much better with a head collar since I can be a bit strong on the lead. I’d really benefit from a home where I have access to quiet walking areas with minimal other dogs around — dog-heavy places can be a bit much for me.

I’d prefer to be the only dog in the home, as other dogs can make me feel overwhelmed. I might be okay living with small caged animals, with the right introductions but no cats please. I’d also love a secure garden to explore and relax in — 6ft fencing is a must, as I’m tall and curious!

I can live with kids aged 7 and up, as long as they don’t mind having a bigger dog around. Usually, there’s someone at home with me, but I’m comfortable being left for up to six hours when my family goes shopping or out for the day. I currently live with another dog, so it may take me a little time to get used to being left alone on my own but I’m sure I will adjust with time and patience, I’ll be your most loyal, loving companion.

If you’re looking for a big-hearted, soft-natured friend who’ll greet you with a wagging tail and eyes full of love, I’m your boy. Let’s meet — I’m ready for a lifetime of cuddles and companionship.

Love,
Dexter 🐶

Larry is a gentle soul with a heart full of potential. Still young and finding his paws in the world, he can be nervous at first and a little avoidant of people – but with patience, kindness, and time, his confidence starts to blossom. Once he feels safe, Larry’s true personality shines through: a sweet, affectionate boy who loves nothing more than curling up beside you on the sofa for a cuddle.

Rossi is a truly special soul who first arrived at Just for Dogs in the autumn of 2021. Blind from an early age, life in kennels was deeply unsettling for him – the constant barking and noise left him anxious, restless, and living on edge. But everything changed just before Christmas 2022, when he was adopted into a quiet, loving home where he finally felt safe.

In his new home, Rossi blossomed. He had no trouble with house training, never once having an accident indoors, and he adored exploring his large secure garden, quickly learning the familiar paths that guided him back to the house and to his beloved mum, Carole. He was truly cherished and content, and we were blessed to receive joyful photo updates of a dog who finally knew peace.

Heartbreakingly, Rossi’s world has been turned upside down once again following the sudden passing of his mum. He now faces the devastating return to kennels, an environment that is confusing and frightening for him. After knowing the warmth of a loving home, Rossi is desperate for another chance – a forever family who will provide the quiet, gentle, and understanding environment he needs to thrive.

Rossi’s Ideal Home:

A calm, peaceful household where he can feel secure
A secure garden to safely explore and enjoy at his own pace
Patient adopters who will give him time to adjust and shower him with love
Best suited to a home as the only pet, due to a need for space
Can be around older grandchildren, who will respect his space and understand his condition

 

Rossi has already shown what an incredible companion he can be when given the chance. He deserves not just a home, but a family who will help him heal from heartbreak and show him once more that he is safe and loved.

Meet our big, lovable girl and a true gentle giant. Frankie was found in a crate half her size, covered in her own faeces but despite a difficult start in life, she has grown into an affectionate and outgoing dog who loves to greet her people with a wagging tail and a big smile. True to her breed, she is naturally protective and thrives when she has a family or land to look after.

As a Guardian Livestock Breed, Frankie would make a fantastic farm dog or companion in a home with a large garden or smallholding, where she can live up to her role as a protector. She enjoys spending time with her favourite people and would flourish in a calm, loving environment where she can be the centre of attention.

Frankie has trialled living with other dogs and does well with males, so she can share her home with another dog or be just as happy as the only pet. Due to her size, she is best suited to a home without young children. While she is sweet and social indoors, she can be vocal and reactive towards other dogs when out and about, so she will need a confident and experienced handler.

Frankie’s Ideal Home:

An experienced owner, ideally with large or guardian breed knowledge
A secure home with space for her to feel comfortable and purposeful (farm, smallholding, or large garden preferred)
An adult-only household (or older teens) who can respect her size and needs
A family committed to handling her confidently on walks and providing ongoing training

Pugsley,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/pugsley/,Age: 3 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: Greyhound,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"Hello lovely greyhound lovers! My name is Pugsley and I am so very pleased to meet you. I adore meeting new people and I’m super cuddly and affectionate. I like leaning in against legs to take the weight off while I drift off into a relaxing dream world while you absent-mindedly scratch me behind my very soft ears.

I’m an ex-racing greyhound, now in retirement and ready to find my forever home as a pet pooch. I’ve never lived in a home before so I’ll need some guidance and support to help me adjust to my new life. We greyhounds are resilient creatures, often seeking comfort and relaxation so I’m sure I’ll be able to settle down in no time.

So, what sets me apart from the other greyhounds here? Why should you choose to adopt me? Well, if you want to be entertained then I am absolutely your guy. I’m happy to amuse myself, and in the same moment, amuse you too. In particular, I love playing with toys, especially if they squeak. I’ve created a new game for myself which keeps me entertained for ages. I like to bury my toys in my bedding, the more bunched up the bedding the better it is. Then I immediately dig the toy up again, much to my delight, it’s as though I am discovering it for the first time.

I like going for walks and I’ve said hello to quite a few new dogs since I have been here. I’m not particularly interested once we’ve had a brief greet as I’m more keen on continuing my walk. I’m more than happy sharing my new home with another dog, but I probably won’t want to play with them.

As I’ve never lived in a home before I’m not sure how I’ll feel about being there alone when you pop out, but if you build up the time gradually I’m sure I’ll get used to it. I’m more than happy to be adopted by humans who are first time dog owners, as long as you don’t mind a dog that needs to be kept on the lead and muzzled in public. This is because we greyhounds have a strong prey drive and without this we could end up getting into trouble. I also need a home with a secure garden that has 5 foot high fencing throughout.

If you like what you see then why don’t you fill out an application form, you never know, we could be meeting each other very soon.",09/15/2025

My name is Uncle Fester and I am a sweet but shy, gentle natured chap. As far as male greyhounds go I am actually very small, more like the size of our female counterparts.

I’m not the most confident boy, but I think in time I will come out of my shell. I came here from a racing kennel, but my card says I have never actually raced. That being said, I have also never lived in a home environment before so it may take me a little while to adjust but with your help and support I know I will be ok.

I’m yet to discover the joy of playing with toys, perhaps that is something you can help me with.

I’ve enjoyed spending time with other dogs while I have been here so I would be happy finding a home with another dog for company, although I would be equally happy having you all to myself.

I’m looking for a family who have owned a dog before and are happy adopting a dog that needs to wear a muzzle and stay on the lead in public places. As I have never been in a home before I’m not sure how I will feel about being at home on my own. It would be best to start with short stints on my own which can be gradually built up.

If you are looking for a calm, peaceful and loving companion then I may just be the guy for you.",09/15/2025

I promise that you won’t be disappointed. I’m a cracking boy and I’m going to make a fantastic companion for someone. Are you a first time owner but perhaps hadn’t given thought to adopting a greyhound? Let’s see if I can tell you all the reasons why I would be the perfect match for you.

I was once a racing greyhound, I have run many races and I’ve won lots of them. My last race was earlier this year and after being retired I was sent here so that I could find my forever family. Greyhounds are notoriously lazy, like, really lazy.  The staff have mentioned that I am exceptionally so! In fact, if I see a bed or a comfy spot then boom,  I’m straight in there, making it just right. We like a nice walk a couple of times a day and then that’s it. Sofa time!

I’m a really engaging and loving boy. I like to lean against you when I’m having some fuss (another greyhound trait) and I’m more than happy greeting new people when I’m out and about. My favourite thing in the whole world, so far, are toys. Oh my gosh they are just the most amazing things! I love them! I take them to bed with me and lay there, happy as a pig in muck, gently chewing away, of course making sure that they squeak with each chomp.

Greyhounds are known to be very chill creatures. I like getting out for walks where I can have a little nose in new places and meet other dogs too. I’ve been off lead here in a secure paddock with another dog, Kaper, and we enjoyed a little game of chase together. I’d be very happy to share my new home with another dog but it doesn’t worry me if I end up being the only dog in the home either. As an ex-racing greyhound I will need to stay on the lead and wear a muzzle when I am in public places, but don’t worry, I’m completely used to it and it doesn’t bother me. You could rent a sole use dog paddock every so often to let me loose and see me run, with the wind in my ears. I’d quite like that I think.

Although I’ve never lived in a house before, I’m quite a confident boy so I don’t think it’ll take me long to learn the ropes. Eventually I might be able to be left on my own at home for up to 5 hours but you’d need to spend some getting me settled and used to being in the home environment first.

Anyway, I’ve waffled on quite a lot so I’d better let you go, you’ve got an application form to fill in 🙂",09/15/2025

Carmac here. I’m so excited to be able to have the opportunity to tell you all about myself.

I’m a friendly and happy chap, ready to find my place in the world now that I have finished my racing career. I’m looking forward to learning all about how to live in a home, with comfy sofas and humans to give me cuddles whenever I want them. I’m the goodest boy, I meeting people and I’m good at leaning in to make sure I get the best scratches.

I love going for nice walks and I really appreciate having time to stop and sniff all the really interesting smells there are around. I’ve made some lovely new dog friends here and I’ve previously shared a kennel with Springside. We would be happy to live together in an new home, if you have room for us both. Equally we would be happy going to separate new homes.

I’m perfect for first time owners who don’t mind taking on a dog who needs to stay on the lead and wear a muzzle in public. Due to my past I have a high prey drive and pose a risk to small animals.",09/15/2025
Springside,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/springside/,Age: 6 years old,Sex: Female,Breed: Greyhound,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"Hey, I’ve been asked to tell you all about myself, but I’m quite shy so you’ll have to bear with me.

I’m an ex racing greyhound, recently retired, and looking for a retirement home where I will be able to enjoy the finer things life can offer. I’m a little anxious about changing gears in life, partly because I have never experienced a traditional home before, having always lived in a kennel. It might take me a little while to adjust, especially to anything really unusual such as a television. I’ve heard rumours that humans have these really comfy chairs, sofas I think they are called. They sound fantastic so I’m looking forward to giving one of them a try.

Although I am often shy when I first meet new people, I have come to learn that cuddles, neck scratches and chest rubs are really quite nice. I’ve been a really good girl with formal handling with the vet too.The humans have only just found out I like to play with toys. I’d been sneakily testing them out when no-one is looking and leaving them in different places around my kennel for the humans to find but recently forgot myself and played in public. I am fussy when it comes to what food I like, treats included. That said, I know what I like and when I like it I’m happy to tuck in. I’m very good at sharing food items with humans.

My new owners will need to be comfortable with adopting a dog who stays on the lead and wears a muzzle in public. This is due to my natural high prey drive. I’d love to find a quiet new home where I am allowed time to adjust to my new life. I’m best suited to someone who has owned a shy dog before as I will need slow and gentle introductions to my new home and the world outside.

During my time here I have seen lots of dogs in passing, all of which I have been happy to ignore. However, on one occasion when I was on a walk in Saltram, I reacted to an off lead dog who was very tense, stiff and staring hard at me. I really enjoy going out for walks and I love doing lots of sniffing. When I was still in the racing kennels, Carmac and myself used to share a kennel and we are great friends. We would be happy to live separately, but if you fancy taking on two dogs, then we are a ready made pair who would love to live together.

We are a lovely pair, the snuggliest dogs you ever shall meet. We cherish one another but most of all we adore a lap and someone who will stroke us continually until their arm falls off (we will grab you with our paws and bring you back to us if you try to escape).

Zebedee can be a little worried in new places if I’m not there to hold his paw and let him know everything is fine. We can both be a little shy with new people too, but it doesn’t take us long before we are asking for fuss and attention. Zebedee loves playing with toys, he really likes small soft toys with a squeaker, and he likes to play fetch. Now and again I’ll humour him and play tug with him too but most of the time I leave him to play with the humans.

We both like getting out and about for walks and we really enjoy exploring. We are happy greeting new dogs and we tend to ignore them after we have said hello. We adore playing with each other, especially when we have loads of space to burn off our energy.

 

Now and again I can be a little grumpy. This is most likely to happen when I’m being checked over by the vet or if I’m taken by surprise. I’m a gentle soul and I don’t enjoy rough play with humans, I’d much prefer cuddles and strokes.

 

We have a very close relationship so we are looking to find our forever home together. We are only small so we take up hardly any room, I’m sure you can squeeze us both in.

Our new parents will need experience with shy dogs and have a knowledge of resource guarding behaviour.",09/15/2025

I’m Kaper! It’s great to see that you would like to get to know me better, I’m really grateful.

So, where shall I start? OK, well first things first it’s important to tell you that I’m a big ball of energy. I have bags of it and I rarely seem to tire out. That’s why the humans here think I’d be best suited to a working home where I can be on the go all the time, keeping both my mind and body busy. I can’t tell you much about life before Gables, I can’t really remember and the lovely people here don’t have very much information at all.

What I can tell you is that I love to run around and have lots of fun. I’m a playful boy, especially if you have lots of toys for me to enjoy. I’ll happily play tug with you but I also enjoy fetch, I love playing with other dogs too, I’m usually very polite and respectful but I do enjoy a good game of chase if the other dogs is happy to play too. I like a little bit of fuss, on my terms, but I don’t like to be molly coddled. I’m quite an independent young man.

I’m not perfect and recently I did get quite argumentative with the vet which means I will need to wear a muzzle for vet checks. I’m easily over stimulated, sometimes even just a bit too much fuss can set me off into a having a silly moment where I will grab and mouth out of frustration. The staff think that the environment here might be adding to my stress so the quicker I can find a forever home the better. To make sure I am nice and safe I will need to wear a muzzle for at least the first 6 months after I’ve been adopted and hopefully, with the right home and training, these behaviours will subside. I will however need to be kept on the lead in public at all times.

I’m a lovely boy but I need a very active lifestyle to keep me happy. My new owners will need to be experienced with high energy active breeds and be fully committed to keeping me well exercised and my mind stimulated. This is why I really need to be in working home, a farm would just be the best life for me. I’m super intelligent and I am ready and willing to learn. If you have the kind of home I need then I’d really appreciate you filling out the application form. Hopefully I’ll be seeing you very soon.",09/15/2025

I was very loved in my previous home but my owner was elderly and unable to cope caring for me anymore. I arrived with another dog, Darla, and we were going to be rehomed together but sadly we had a disagreement and it was decided that we were better off finding our forever homes separately. Darla has gone off to pastures new (to the home we were going to share together) and I wish her well. I am hoping that my forever after is just around the corner too,

Don’t let my age fool you, I’m full of energy and always on the go! I’m bursting with charisma and I’m always ready to charm anyone who wants to be my friend. I love meeting new people and at times I can be a little over the top with my human greetings. I just cherish being fussed but I also adore playing with toys, tug is so much fun, so I’d love to meet humans who want to play with me.

I treasure going for walks and I walk very nicely on the lead. I’m very polite and happy around other dogs but the I fell out with Darla because I was suffering with ear pain. It is likely that this could happen again with another dog if my ears flair up again in the future, so to avoid this I’d prefer to be the only dog. The staff here think that I am a brilliant companion for someone who has owned a dog before, who can give me the attention and care that I deserve. I am very much looking forward to joining a new family and I can’t wait to have lots of fun new adventures.",09/15/2025

I’m really glad that you are here wanting to find out more about me. I am a very charismatic young man who adores having cuddles and a lap to sit on. I can be shy when meeting new people but after some treats and time to get to know them I am very happy to have lots of attention and gentle affection. I will quite often ask to be picked up for a cuddle and recently I have been spending time in the supervisors office where I have made myself quite at home. Although I can be unsure meeting new people I have been very brave and well behaved when having my veterinary checks and vaccinations since being here. I am also already neutered and I am clean in my kennel and in the office.

I’m wasn’t too sure what to make of toys when I first came here but I’ve started to enjoy playing with small soft toys occasionally, although I do get bored quickly. I enjoy going for walks and I walk really nicely on my lead and harness. I prefer to go for walks in quiet places as I am likely to find busy environments too over whelming.

I would really love to meet someone who has a quiet home where I can be the centre of attention and my new owners can help me build my confidence out and about on walks to show me the world in not such a scary place.

I feel honoured. Well, I’m an aloof girl when you first meet me, but don’t let this put you off. I’m just a slow burner. Offering me a toy can be a really good ice breaker as I blooming love them. I adore those ones that are like teddy bears but have a squeak. I’ve accumulated quite a few in my kennel already! I’m a very tidy girl and when I’m done playing I’ll put the toys away in the toy box, well I did here anyway.

 

I’m a high energy girl and I can’t wait to find active people so we can go on lots of adventures together. Once you’ve gained my trust I can be quite cuddly and I’ll use trusted people to look to for reassurance if I’m worried about what’s going on around me. I’m very frightened when I have to see the vet so I need to wear a muzzle to keep me and the vet safe.

 

I presume you’d like to know what happened to lead to me ending up here, Well, I’ve been in the same home with the same family since I was a baby. I was living with two other dogs, one male who I got on very well with, and one female who I fell out with after she had a litter of puppies. Sadly our relationship was beyond repair so I was unable to stay in the same home as her. When meeting other dogs I can be a little tense and unsure at first but within a few moments I’m much more relaxed. I would be prepared to share my home with a male dog who doesn’t show interest in playing with toys.

 

I’m a polite lady who can sit and drop when I’m asked. There’s plenty of room for me to learn some new tricks but I’m pretty good with basic manners and I have been house trained in my previous home.

I’m a very loving and snuggly boy. As a mature gentleman I appreciate those home comforts that retirement homes usually have to offer . A snuggly sofa or a cosy duvet and that’s where you’ll find me for the majority of the day.

I’m really good when it comes to being handled all over and I am more than happy to have the vet check me over when needed. I’m quite happy meeting new people both at home and out and about, as long as they aren’t tiny humans as they cause me a lot of anxiety. I adore being brushed and it you stop before I am ready I’ll give you a nudge to ask for more. I’ve recently had my teeth spruced up (and a few taken out) so my pearly whites are ready to help me shine.

 

I can get super excited by toys when I am in the mood and humans are there to get me excited by them. I’m most likely to play with a soft toy and when I’m in the garden. Toys in the house are more likely to become pillows.

I used to be really friendly with other dogs but after an incident in my past I am now reactive when I meet a new dog for the first time. With the right introductions (from a big distance to start) I can make new friends but this has to be done very slowly and carefully. My new owners will need to have owned a reactive dog before and be able to exercise me in very quiet places to avoid stressing me out on walks. It would be really nice we could go to a sole use paddock once in a while. The ones were you rent the space for an hour so that I am able to blow away the cobwebs off the lead somewhere safe. Due to my breed and behaviour I’ll need to stay on the lead and wear my muzzle in all public places so these paddocks are a great place for me to enjoy the great outdoors safely.

I’ve recently met another greyhound when I’ve been out and about and we got on really well. I’d consider a home with another existing greyhound (but no other breeds) although I can’t guarantee that we will be friends, I’d be willing to try.

In my previous home I liked travelling in the car and I was happy being left on my own for up to 5 hours. I’ll keep the soda warm for you while your out. If you think we could be a match I’d really love it of you could fill in an application form. At my age I don’t want to be spending too long here waiting for my forever home when I know there is a spot on the sofa by a warm fire just waiting to be filled.",09/15/2025

It’s best I start right at the beginning so you have a better understanding of the canine that I am. I arrived at Gables in 2023 emaciated and starving. Luckily I was rescued before it was too late and slowly I regained weight and condition. Medically I am completely ok now but behaviourally I still have some small niggles that I’ll need a bit of help with.

 

I can be quite shy and anxious when I meet new people but I’m an exuberant young man who has bags of energy. I’m a real cheeky chap with an affectionate side once you get to know me. When I’m in the mood for a cuddle I like to reverse up to you and will sit on your lap or knee. I also quite enjoy a calm and gentle massage from time to time. I often find restraint and vet visits a bit scary so I wear a muzzle just to be safe.

I adore all kinds of toys, especially soft squeaky ones. I can be a bit over excited at times but this is just because I’m still young and I’ve not had much opportunity to find out about the world. I’m a super playful chap and this is a great way to help me feel at ease.

I love getting out for my walks and I really enjoy exploring the woodland areas of Saltram. I can’t wait to go on lots of adventures with my new family. I keep thinking of all the really exciting and interesting places I’ll get to see, imagine the fun we can have together

I like most dogs that I meet but I can be confused by those ones with flat or unusual faces causing me to become a bit defensive. When socialising with other dogs I can be quite over the top at times which is the reason why I am looking for a home as the only dog. Also this will give you and me the one to one time that I really want. As I’m not every dogs cup of tea I do need to stay in lead in public and I happily wear my muzzle which keeps me out of trouble. This is something, as my new owner, you would need to be happy continuing with.

I’m really love to meet someone who has owned larger bull breeds in the past.

I’m looking for someone who knows how to build my confidence in a positive way. I’m such a sweet boy and I have so much to offer. I just need you to have some faith in me and pop in an application form with my name on it.",09/15/2025

I have been at Gables for a little while now and I have had a troubled time in the past. I’m afraid I can’t divulge too much about what happened but just know that I am happier here. I can tell you that there were times in my past life when I was put under too much pressure.

I’m a sweetheart. I might be a bit shy when we first meet but just give me a few minutes and it doesn’t take me long to come out of my shell. I have bags of energy and plenty of love to give. I have learnt so much since I have been here at Gables but there are some traits that are inherent which means they will always be part of my character. One of these inherent traits is resource guarding. I don’t share food and if I am ever challenged for it I will growl, snap and bite.

I’m a playful girl and I love spending time in the paddocks where I can run and play with all the toys. When I’m in the mood I will bring toys over and put them in your hand, this means ‘let’s play together’. Sometimes I like to take my toys to bed, or lay down outside and play on my own. If you try to take my toys or play with me at this point I will become guarded and I may growl to tell you not to approach me. I’ve learnt so much since I have been here and I have shown how quickly I can pick up new skills. They are currently working on teaching me to ‘leave it’ which could be really helpful for me in the future.

I used to be very strong on the lead and I would pull like train when on walks. However I have undergone loose lead training and I am very good on the lead now. Most of the time I walk to heel, apart from when I see a squirrel or anything else super exciting. I can also sit, lie down, give paw and put my paws ‘up’ on your arm.

When I first came to Gables I loved being around other dogs. I liked to play off lead and I was often out and about making friends. I began to suffer with ear infections which took quite a while to get under control. My ears were very painful and I became sensitive to other dogs being around them. Despite having no issues with my ears for ages now as I am on really good medication, I still worry about other dogs touching my ears and I will snap at them if I am concerned.  I have also displayed resource guarding behaviour with other animals so for this reason I am looking for a home as the only pet.

I would love to meet a person or couple who have a very quiet home who like to keep themselves to themselves. Due to my past I am not able to be around children of any age at any time. I will need owners who have experience with food guarding behaviour as without the right knowledge we could all be put at risk. I will need to wear a muzzle when I see the vet, have baths, when I’m brushed and for any formal handling of any kind. I am eager to please and I love learning new things so I would be really happy to attend agility classes in the future.

I really am a lovely girl who just needs to be in the right environment with the right people in order to reach my full potential and flourish.",09/15/2025

I’m so glad you stopped by to read my information. My name is Yogi and I’ve come to Gables to search of my happily ever after.

I like meeting new people and I enjoy spending time with those I already know too. When I see any of my human friends I get so excited I ‘AWOOOOOO’ at them. If you click the link to my video above you’ll see exactly what I mean by that. When meeting strangers I much more controlled and usually walk past calmly.

Since being here I have discovered my love for teddies. You don’t even need to engage with me while I play as I am very happy throwing the toys around and catching them all by myself. I need plenty of room to play in though as I don’t always look where I am going when I’m having such a great time. When I’m ready to get humans involved in my game I will bring the toy over and push it into your hands to ask you to play with me.

I like going for walks and most of the time I walk really nicely on my lead and harness. I’m happy to go for walks anywhere as I am comfortable meeting people and dogs. Before coming here I was living outside, which means I’m not used to what you humans call a home. I’ve also heard all about this thing you call a sofa from the other dogs and I’m actually quite excited to give one a try. In my previous life I was used as a working dog and I was trained to hunt other animals which has left me with a very high prey drive. I do however love the company of other dogs and I get super excited, bouncing up and down, when I get to say hello to one. To protect other animals (cats, sheep etc) on walks I need to find a caregiver who will happily keep me on the lead and make sure I am wearing my muzzle when we are out and about. I’ve been muzzle trained and I am more than happy wearing it.

As I’ve not been in a home before I will need some help and guidance to know what is expected of me in this new kind of environment. I would like to live with caregivers who have experience with sight hounds and have a secure garden for me to play in with very high (6ft) and secure fencing as I do have a very high bounce. I’m a bit like Tigger.

I love walks and I would really like two 30-40 minute walks daily. Having not been in a home environment before I’m not sure how I’ll feel about being left on my own, however I settle nicely in my kennel and enjoy a good nap.",09/15/2025

Thankfully my life was saved and I was brought here to start again. My job entailed chasing things that like to run fast, so although I’m not as good at it as I used to be I still have the desire to chase.

Although I can be wary when I meet new people I quickly come around and that is when you’ll see my soft side. I love a cuddle and I like to bury my face into armpits to feel safe. I don’t like to play with toys and I’m very scared when anything gets picked up near me.

I walk very nicely on the lead and I am very happy to wear my muzzle when I go for a walk. This is a very good way to keep me, and any small animals that may cross my path, safe.

I would really love to meet someone who has owned sight hounds before. I know with the right love and care I will flourish in a new home, if only you’ll give me the chance.",09/15/2025
Bilbo,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/bilbo/,Age: 8 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: Smooth fox terrier,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"Hello terrier lovers, I’m Bilbo.

I’d like to start by telling you about what happened to me before I was rescued and taken to safety here at Gables. I was found living in a dirty crate where I was being kept for 23 hours a day. I was found with my 3 puppies and their mother. Our needs were not being met both physically and emotionally which has left us frustrated, stressed and full of energy. Unfortunately my forever home is yet to be found despite me being at Gables for quite a while now. I have come a long way in my rehabilitation since then and I am a much calmer and more affectionate boy than I used to be.

I am super motivated by toys and these are a great way to keep me busy when I get a bit too over excited. I do enjoy a bit of rough play with humans which can lead to gentle mouthing but this isn’t an unusual behaviour for any dog when they are very excited. I’ve really learnt to enjoy affection since being here and I’ve been known to sit in a lap now and again too. Despite my macho exterior I quite like being held like a baby too. But shhh, don’t tell my friends.

 

Food is another love of my life. I’m a clever boy and I can already sit, beg and lie down when I’m asked to. Being motivated by food makes training much easier and I would love to learn loads of new things once I am settled into my forever home. I’m a very intelligent boy and I think we could have a lot of fun together when we are training.

 

Fox terriers in general are a very clever bunch and we need lots of input both physically and mentally. I love getting enrichment boxes here and I enjoy going for sniffy walks which keeps my mind active.

 

When I arrived at Gables I was not at all socialised with dogs leaving me frustrated and unable to say hello nicely. However I have been gradually exposed to dogs here and I have learnt how to greet politely out and about. I have come such a long way with my socialisation although on the very odd occasion there is still a dog that I take exception too. To protect me from getting into trouble I will need to stay on the lead in public places and wear a muzzle. I’ve been properly muzzle trained here and it doesn’t worry me in the slightest. To give me a good run off lead without a muzzle in safety you could book a rentable dog paddock such as Pawprints Hazelmere Farm in Ivybridge.

 

I am looking to meet someone who has owned terriers or similar before. Due to my sheltered past I will need a lot of help settling into a new home. With the right help, space and guidance I know I can be the goodest boy. I just need you to be understanding and patient while I adjust. When I first came here and for a few months afterwards I used to be grabby when I became over stimulated. This means that I would grab hold of the lead or the closest humans clothing, usually sleeves. This was my coping mechanism as I just didn’t know what to do when the world became over whelming. I don’t do this anymore as I have learnt better ways to deal with stress, including collecting a toy when I have a desire to hold something in my mouth. There is a very small chance this could happen again in the future while I adjust to my new life. Although I have always been a good boy when I see the vet I do wear my muzzle, just in case the experience causes this grabbing behaviour to return.

 

I am really excited about the next chapter of my life and I hope that if you have the experience I need, that you will fill out an application form. I know that taking on a dog like me will be a huge commitment and plenty of hard work but with the right training methods (positive only) and the right amount of exercise I know I can be a very enjoyable companion to have around. You’ll need a secure garden with 5ft high fencing throughout for me to play in as when I am in public places I will need to remain on a lead.",09/15/2025
Kevin,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/kevin/,Age: 6 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: Crossbreed,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"My life has been full of hardship and difficulties. I have already been in 3 different homes before I arrived at the safety of Gables. My first owners tried to train me as a gundog but as I wasn’t very good at it they no longer wanted me. The sad part is they were prepared to shoot me. Luckily I was saved by a farmer who rehomed me to a family with small children after I had been attacked by a large dog. With all the trauma and upheaval I had already faced I found living with a young family too much which is why I found my way here.

Despite such a hard start I think I have been a very lucky boy to have been given another amazing chance at happiness. I have been here for a while now and I know that is because the humans want to make sure I find a home that is perfect for me with people who can help me thrive. Potential adopters will need to have owned sighthounds in the past and have experience in owning an under socialised dog and dogs with resource guarding issues. Sadly my bad experience with the dog from the past has left me unable to socialise or be close to other dogs. To keep me safe and out of trouble I will need to be kept on the lead and muzzled in public for the rest of my life. I am quite happy with this as I feel very safe when I am on the lead and close to my handler.

Although I can find meeting new people stressful once I am bonded with someone you will see my cuddly side. I like having my back end scratched and I will snuggle my head into you when I want a cuddle.

I am a very playful young man and I love to have off lead time in the secure paddocks here at Gables. The brilliant thing is that with so many private rentable secure paddocks in the area my new owners will still be able to give me the freedom of off lead play but in a totally safe environment. I adore playing with toys and I am really good at playing fetch. I quite enjoy giving the toy to my handler and grabbing it back quickly when they go to pick it up. I find it hilarious.

I am very motivated by food which is the best thing to use as a distraction when there is another dog around. I have shown some resource guarding behaviour around my food in the kennels so I prefer to be left alone during meal times. I know how to sit when I’m asked but I still need other basic training once I’m finally in my forever home. My new home will need a secure garden with 5ft high fencing. Due to my past I absolutely can’t be around children, even if they only visit very occasionally. My home needs to be my sanctuary and I am very unsettled around kids.

I feel now is my time to shine! If you feel that you have the time and experience that I am looking for then I would be very grateful if you filled out an application form.",09/15/2025
Seven,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/seven/,Age: 7 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: Collie,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"I arrived at Gables when I was just 11 months old. At such a young age I had already been through so much turmoil and distress. I’d been suffering physical abuse at the hands of the person I should have been able to trust the most, then I was abandoned with a family member and left tied to a table leg. I was scared, confused and feeling extremely vulnerable. After 24 hours I was finally rescued but due to my state of mind I wasn’t exactly pleased to see the person who had come to save me. Being abused at such a young and impressionable age has left me with emotional scars and trust issues which I may never get over.

When I’m faced with the presence of a stranger I just don’t know how to cope and I go into panic mode. I really hope that in time and with lots of positive training this may get better, but it will take a very experienced and special person to want to take on such a big challenge. In order for me to stay safe when I’m out in public I wear a muzzle and I am always on the lead. This will need to continue for the rest of my life as it is unlikely that the emotional baggage I carry will ever fully go away.

After lots of very careful and gentle exposure to new people I can learn to trust and when I do you will see a whole other side to me. I am so affectionate, in fact I usually greet my ‘friends’ with a big bear hug. As an adolescent working dog I am full of energy and I am incredibly smart. I would thrive on learning new things; how cool would it be if I could learn to tidy up my toys or help you with the washing! Since arriving at Gables I have learnt some of the basics including sit, give paw, lie down and roll over but I have so much more that I want to learn! I am tennis ball obsessed, nothing else in the whole world is better than chasing that small yellow ball through the air and returning it for another go.

I think I’d really enjoy agility too, but I would need to do this on my own as I would be too overwhelmed to do it in a group class. My ideal home would be in a very rural location. Perhaps someone who has land (although it must be totally secure with boundaries of 6ft) where I can exercise without the stress of having to meet strangers. I may be living in a dream land asking for this but if you don’t ask then you don’t get.

What kind of home am I looking for?

My new owners must have experience with fear aggressive high energy dogs and be prepared to take on a project. I have now been in kennels for over 4 years and since arriving I have developed guarding behaviour around food. Potential adopters will need to have owned a dog with guarding issues before and be able to give me a safe environment to eat without competition. I realise that I am not the ‘perfect’ dog, but my friends here have said I am perfect just as I am and my forever home is out there somewhere with people who will love me for me.",09/15/2025
Moomoo,https://gables.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/dog-cat-alogue/img/holding-pic.png,https://gables.org.uk/dogalogue/moomoo/,Age: 11 years old,Sex: Female,Breed: Boerboel,,PL7 1UQ,Gables,"It’s time to put on my positive pants and tell you my story. I was originally living in a family home along with my sister and we were very happy. I began to suffer with a skin condition and as the vet bills increased my owners were unable to afford my care so I was relinquished to another rescue centre for treatment and rehoming.

It was during my stay there that people started to realise I had some problems other than my skin. I lacked confidence around people I didn’t know and I found it hard to express my feelings productively when I was scared, causing me to lash out. At over 45kgs in weight this was quite a problem and after some months in their care they felt that the amazing people here at Gables would be better equipped to help me with my anxieties.

Since arriving at Gables in 2018 I have spent a lot of time with the dog behaviourist and my main carers to help me learn how to cope when I meet someone new. I have learnt so much and although I still don’t like it if strangers approach me or try to communicate with me, I have learnt how to stay calm when people are nearby.

In 2020 I thought my luck had changed and after 4 months of spending time with people who wanted adopt me I went to a new home. But despite everyone’s best efforts and hard work things just didn’t work out between myself and their existing dog and I had to be returned. Everyone was very sad but we are now ready to move on and find me a new home but this time as the only dog.

I’m a loyal dog and I certainly make people work for my friendship. But I promise you that once we have built up a trusting and respectful relationship I am the most amazing, funny, characterful dog that you could meet. I’m a smart cookie and although it may take me a few goes to learn something new I really enjoy the process of learning new things as I am totally focused when food is concerned.

Much like Joey from friends….I don’t share food. A girl my size needs every morsel I can get. I have to have a special diet to keep my skin in tip top shape but luckily I love it so it doesn’t bother me. I can’t have extras or tid bits as these could cause my skin to flare up but I’m happy with what I’m allowed to have, just so long as you leave me alone while I have it.

I love to roll in grass, I only play with toys when it’s raining or the ground is wet, I like going for walks in quiet places, I love a good chat and I like playing search games too. I have so much to offer and after all I have been through I deserve happiness.

 

What kind of home am I looking for?

I am looking for a very special owner who has experience with large reactive guarding breeds and who can handle a big girl like me. I need to go to a rural location so I don’t have to worry about lots of people being around and I would like a lovely big secure garden to play in. I definitely can’t be around children at any time and I need to be the only dog in the home.

This stunning boy is Thor. His only crime was being a puppy. He was surrendered by his owner to a dog warden for being ""too bouncy"", at 7mths old it's what you would expect from him or any pup.
Thor was mere hours from being PTS (in an English pound). This lovely boy has shown himself to be a friendly and happy boy so far.
He was said to live with a child under 5 and with another dog in his pervious home. We would be seeking a home with older children if any, due to him being bouncy.
This boy needs someone who is willing to take him to training classes (we hold dog school here at the kennels). He will make an amazing companion for someone.
He's said to be a Greyhound cross Malinois but has the soppy nature of the Greyhound. A very gentle and friendly boy. During his short time with us, he’s shown himself to be a very gentle, sweet little boy of 11 months.",09/15/2025

Scrappy is 1 year old, he is quite a happy dog, who adores to play out on the paddock. Scrappy does unfortunately have some issues trusting other dogs and would benefit from training/ dog school. Please do not let this put you off, he is a lovely boy with all the people he knows here and gets extremely excited when he sees or spends time with them. Scrappy's ideal home would be with no other dogs/ animals, he could possibly live with teenagers and needs an active family.

Trixie was originally from Egypt when she first came to Mutts (2017), whilst there, she lost her eye but she definitely doesn't let it slow her down. She loves being out on the paddock whether it be zooming around or finding a shady spot to chill out in the beautiful sunshine. Trixie walks well on a halti and is well behaved at dog school. She can be wary of dogs she doesn't know but in the past has made friends with some, so we think that walking buddies wouldn't be an issue once properly introduced. We would like a home with no other dogs, as this is what she's used to.
So far in the kennels she has happily greeted people she is unfamiliar with and she is overjoyed when she sees those she does know!

Meet Willow a 2 year old Lurcher type. She came to Mutts as an unclaimed stray who was going to be PTS in a British pound.
This lovely lady has been in a wonderful foster home. She is now ready to find her forever home.
This is what her foster family have said about her :
When Willow arrived at her foster home, she was very shut down and frightened. She clearly had never lived in a home.
Willow is happy to travel in the car, may have to be reintroduced to a new vehicle.
She’s been learning to walk nicely on lead. She does get frustrated (not aggressive) when other dogs run up to her, this is likely due to the restriction of a lead and never being on one before. With continued training it is something that can be worked on.
She does well being walked on loose lead too.
She is an intelligent and bright girl, who is eager to please.
She has been introduced to other dogs and seemed to behave well. Any other dogs would need to be of similar size.
She loves chews and toys.
She can initially be wary of strangers but will soon warm up to new people - especially after a cocktail sausage.
She is almost housed trained but may need reminding when going into a new home.
After spending 12 weeks in her wonderful foster home she has learnt a lot and started to trust people. She’s experienced fun things and we would love for her to find that again soon.
This youngster just needs someone to show her the ropes, she will flourish into a lovely companion.",09/15/2025

Darwin is a gorgeous Malinois x Sighthound. Despite Darwin's grey face, he has lovely white teeth, so Darwin could range from 5-8 years old. In kennels he is a very friendly chap, so can live with children over 15 yrs.
Darwin will need 6 foot or higher fences and he won't be able to be left in the garden alone. Darwin has not been tested with cats or dogs yet but this can be arranged if needed.
He adores everyone he meets.
Please don't be put off by his gorgeous frosted face, dogs who are darker around the muzzle/eyes tend to go grey earlier in life. He still loves to run around the paddock. Another one of his favourite activities is sunbathing, we often see him catching a few ZZZs while he's out on the paddock. It's tiring work being so handsome! Darwin has been an angel at doggies school around the other dogs and even said hello to Mutts dog Merlin.
Darwin is a superb boy. Always has a smile on his face and rarely lets anything get him down. During his time with us, Darwin has shown himself to be a lovely chap, super friendly to everyone he meets but it appears he can be food possessive. As long as food is kept away and he is left alone while eating, we are sure he can still be the perfect companion for someone as he learns that nobody is going to take his food away. Everyone who has met Darwin in person will tell you how extremely loving he is.
All Darwin is looking for is someone to love him and teach him that he doesn't need to worry that his food is going to be taken away. We won't ever know what his past was but we are guessing that he was starved. He was very skinny when he came in to Mutts, which probably accounts for his possessiveness over food. We do know he can have the most amazing future with the right family.",09/15/2025

Lilah is a very confident, affectionate girl. She adores attention.
Linus is a little more shy but he’s still happy and friendly.
They love being out on the paddock, so would love to join you on all your adventures. They could possibly go to a family with children, providing they are understanding and respectful of dogs.

Tommy has had a rough start to his short life so far - at only 10 months old this youngster has had 2 major operations. 1 to remove a bit of towel he had decided to eat and the other to remove a small piece of his intestine. This hasn't caused any other serious issues to his health though - he can still live a happy normal life.
Tommy is looking for a patient home who can help him with his nerves - being a rescue from Bosnia he doesn't have much experience living in a home apart from his amazing foster while he recovered.
His looking for an experienced home, he can go with other dogs but needs to meet them a few times first. He's a young lad, house trained but needs to learn some rules. He will learn fast. Medium size, no cats. Could possibly live with older children.
Tommy attended his first ever lesson at dog school on Friday and it was said he did very well after the initial excitement. His handler said he seems to be a quick learner so training shouldn't be an issue. He's also been learning to walk nicely on a figure of eight lead.

Mutts have been asked to help this beautiful tortoiseshell, Holly.
She was sadly taken to the vets to be PTS, Mutts don’t often get asked to help with cats but how could we say no and let this beautiful girly die.
Holly is spayed and is roughly around 12 years young. She has been used to a quiet home so that is what we’d ideally be seeking again. So far while she’s been with us she’s shown herself to be affectionate.
She isn’t keen on being picked up and was taken to the vet as she was said she DOES NOT allow people to move her off their laps when they try to get up. We’re looking for an owner who understands cats.
She enjoys a stroke but does not like being picked up / touched on her sides. No children.
There must be a loving home for this beautiful girly, she is confused at the moment wondering where her family of 12 years has gone. Hopefully she can get settled in quickly to her new loving home.",09/15/2025

We are searching for a very special home for Max, a three-year-old Pomski.
Handsome Max recently arrived at the sanctuary due to a change in his owner’s housing.
Max is an intelligent boy who can be anxious around new people but, once he gets to know you, soon forms a close bond. Potential owners would need to visit the sanctuary on a few occasions to get to know Max before he leaves the sanctuary.
Max is keen to learn and has enjoyed mastering new tricks since arriving at Woodside. He also loves playing ball.
Sadly Max was attacked by another dog in the past and is reactive with other dogs when out and about. We are searching for an experienced owner who has been around reactive dogs and has the time and knowledge to help Max relax on walks.
Max has not lived with children and will need a home with no other dogs or cats.

Jago is a 2 year old, male Cane Corso. He is a lovable, gentle giant and has such a sweet docile personality. Jago has previously lived with dogs, and is very good with others whilst out on walks. He walks very well on the lead, and his recall is ok when he is let off in secure areas with his favourite people.

Jago is good with both cats and children, and has been around them in his previous home. Due to his nervous nature he can be unsure when initially meeting new people, but once he gets to know you and gains your trust he lets his guard down and loves to have a cuddle. He travels well in the car, and is ok to be left for a few hours in the home.

Jago was brought in to the sanctuary via the RSPCA, after his owner was unable to care for him. He was originally imported from abroad as a puppy, along with his sister.

Who’s a clever boy, then? The answer is most definitely Luca, an intelligent, energetic boy who is searching for new owners who can match the speed of his mind and body.

It’s now more two years since lovely Luca arrived at the sanctuary and, with little interest, he’s starting to lose hope of finding that special someone who will appreciate his goofy, stubborn and mischievous ways.

Luca, who is nearly 3-years-old Luca, is a Husky Sharpei X who is full of character and curiosity. His entertaining behaviour is sure to raise a smile as well as your stature – as this boy will keep you on your toes!

Luca loves charging around in the fields with his canine companions and challenging his brain with enrichment activities. Treat-based hide-and-seek is one of his favourite games. He doesn’t like being left alone for long periods so would need someone at home for much of the day, or would possibly make a great work companion for someone.

Luca needs an adult-only home with an experienced, confident dog owner who has the time to continue his training, especially around food, and will introduce firm boundaries that will help him to settle and mature. Luca has a high prey drive and needs a home with no other pets.

We are searching for a very special home for gorgeous girl, Ghost.

Ghost is a deaf Collie X Beagle who is struggling with life in kennels. Unable to hear when her carers are approaching, Ghost is easily startled and on walks her anxieties escalate, causing her to react to dogs and people.

Ghost’s carers are spending lots of time with her, using specialist training methods, including hand signals, heel work and focus training, to gain her trust.

Working one-to-one, Ghost has formed a strong bond with carers, and in a controlled training setting is making progress. But in unpredictable environments Ghost, who is approaching two-years-old, is finding it hard to cope and will react to discourage dogs and people from approaching.

Ghost arrived at the sanctuary because she was not getting on with another dog in the home.

She is a playful, intelligent, active dog who will benefit from lots of physical and mental stimulation, and an owner who has experience with deaf and reactive dogs and the time to continue her socialisation and training.

If you think you could be Ghost’s special person, we’d love to hear from you!

Say hello to beautiful Bodie, a 3 year old male Husky cross  wo loves a snuggle with his carers here at the sanctuary.

Bodie is a friendly boy who doesn’t realise his size and will try to lie on your lap!

He hasn’t had much experience of the outside world and can be a little unsure in new situations, however he doesn’t let this hold him back and with a bit of encouragement he is learning to love going out on adventures and meeting people. He is sometimes reluctant to walk but with patience and reassurance he is gradually growing in confidence.

Bodie is strong on the lead and is learning how to walk nicely. He is an escape artist – something his new owners will need to be aware of – and has been kept on a long line on walks in the forest and in our enclosed fields.

An adopter experienced in Husky-type breeds would be ideal for Bodie. Bodie can live with children aged 8 years + but he cannot live with cats.

While some dogs greet you with a waggy tail, bouncy boy Bobby can go one better and will literally jump for joy. Adorable Bobby is fondly known as the sanctuary’s kangaroo and we hope it won’t be long before he jumps straight into the arms of a loving family.

Five-year-old Bobby is currently Woodside’s longest-staying canine resident, having spent nearly three years at the sanctuary. And we just don’t understand why. Whether it’s a dog to snuggle up with on the sofa, a walking companion or simply a canine friend, adorable Bobby has all these boxes ticked.

Ex-racer Bobby is a friendly, affectionate boy who loves having a cuddle. He has won the hearts of staff here at the sanctuary with his soft nature but, for some reason, potential adopters have not fallen for his loving ways.

The way to Bobby’s heart is definitely food. He also loves toys however, having had little experience of them before arriving here, he’s not always happy to give them up! This is something his carers continue to work on.

While Bobby is happy to walk with other dogs he does like his own company and would prefer a home with no other dogs. He loves people and could live with a family with children aged 16+. Due to his racing background, Bobby cannot live with cats and needs to be muzzled on walks.

If you think Bobby could be your winner, please click on the link below to fill out an interest form or call the sanctuary on 01752 347503.

When Husky cross Papa first arrived at Woodside, simply leaving his kennel was too much for this nervous boy.

Having had little experience of the world outside, he was afraid of new situations. But fast forward a few weeks, and Papa is growing in confidence and now looks forward to going out on adventures.

Papa, who is three years old, was brought to Woodside with his brother, Bodie because their owner’s landlord wouldn’t allow them to remain in the property.

He is learning to walk nicely on a lead, enjoy meeting people and is curious when he see’s his canine pals on walks – though Papa does like to shout about it!

Papa is an intelligent, friendly dog who has lots of energy. We’re told he’s an escape artist – something his new owners will need to be aware of – and he’s been walked on a long line at the sanctuary.

He will require a experienced in Husky-type breeds.

Papa cannot live with cats but he can live with children aged 12+.

Lost your mojo? Then we could have the perfect dog for you. The handsome Mojo will bring positive vibes into the life of anyone who’s lucky enough to take him home.
Mojo, a Spaniel X Lurcher, is super-cute and loves attention. He has so much love to give, and his friendly, affectionate nature has won the hearts of his carers and dog walkers here at the sanctuary.
Nine-year-old Mojo is a chilled boy who loves a cuddle and sniffing in the fields. Since being at the sanctuary Mojo has been good on a lead, likes to play but equally happy to chill and will sit for a treat (and bark if they don’t arrive quickly enough!).  In his previous home, his owners did report that once settled, he started to become reactive on a lead so new owners will need to be aware of this.  We have taken Mojo into lots of different environments and have not had any problems.
Mojo hadn’t experienced much of the outside world when he first came to the sanctuary, so adventures are exciting for this boy, who will trot along taking in the sights and sounds around him.
He’s happy to say hello to his canine pals but can be overwhelmed if they get too boisterous, and will try to get away. He has never lived with another dog. Mojo hasn’t been around children before so a home with older children aged 16+ would be best. He might chase cats.

Deedee is a beautiful 4-year-old Spaniel/Labrador cross with a heart full of love and so much potential. She’s spayed, vaccinated, and up-to-date with flea and worm treatments.

This sweet girl has lived with cats, dogs, and children, but due to her sensitive nature, we believe a calm, patient home would suit her best. Deedee is still building her confidence and needs someone willing to take things slow, earning her trust through kindness, consistency, and love.

The world can feel overwhelming for Deedee—especially car rides, new people, and unfamiliar dogs on walks—but with guidance and support, she’s learning every day. She’s a smart girl who thrives on games and training, and her affectionate side shines through once she feels safe. Just ask her previous fosterer—she’s a total lap dog in the making!

Deedee doesn’t have a mean bone in her body. What she truly needs is someone who will build a bond with her and help her blossom into the loyal, loving companion we know she is.

He can be left for up to 3 hours Dexter is a lovely natured boy but will become frustrated if his needs are not being met and will find his own job to do.

Chulo and Stormi are two adorable Chihuahuas who are as loving as they come! This bonded duo is looking for a quiet, child-free home where they can soak up all the love and attention.

Chulo is a 4.5-year-old male with dark tan fur and a gentle soul. He’s the more reserved of the two but is incredibly sweet and just wants a lap to curl up in.

Stormi is a 4-year-old sandy-coloured female and the more confident of the pair. She’s full of personality and loves to play — especially tug-of-war with Chulo!

They adore each other, love a good cuddle, and enjoy playing together. While they’re generally happy dogs, they can be a little nervous around larger dogs and may bark at new people — but once they know you, they’re all snuggles and affection.

They will come neutered, vaccinated, flea- and worm-treated, and are used to being left alone for up to 4 hours.

Although Chulo and Stormi have previously lived with children, we feel they’d be happiest in a calm, adult-only home where they can fully relax and enjoy all the attention. They haven’t lived with cats, and because they love being the centre of attention, they’d do best as the only dogs in the household.

????? They’ve never been off-lead, so will need recall training and ongoing support with their confidence and social skills.

Sadly, they’re being rehomed through no fault of their own. All they need now is a second chance and someone to love them as much as they love each other.

If you can offer these two a loving forever home, please complete our adoption form.",09/15/2025

Vinny is a one year old staffie X bulldog and a bundle of fun!
He has been very loved by his current family and if you want a bonkers cuddly bull breed in your home, he’s the dog for you!

Before anyone asks re size etc … Vinny is a BIG lad and very strong, he has been checked by police with his current family and does NOT meet the measurements as assessed on the banned breeds list.

Vinny’s owners can no longer care for him sadly due to health issues.

Vinny is very friendly with people but incredibly clumsy and over-excitable at times.
He needs a home with no young children and no other pets as he would definitely chase.

Vinnie hasn’t much experience with other dogs so he needs to be the only dog in his new home.

Secure fenced garden and an owner strong enough to hold him in the lead is important!
Ideally we would like the gorgeous Vinny to go to an experienced bull breed home!

Vinny dislikes the rain and although he loves his walks and a good run in secure areas he doesn’t have a huge amount of stamina for very long walks..
Vinny has a sensitive tummy at times and we can give new adopters details of his diet.
Vinny is up to date with his vaccines, worming, flea treatment and has just been neutered.

At any one time we have a number of greyhounds and lurchers in kennels that are looking for a loving home, some may not appear on our website. This could be ‘a dog for you’….a dog that may be matched to you according to the information you provide on the bottom of this profile. Registering your interest here gives you a greater opportunity to be considered for a dog that suits your circumstances, but keep an eye on the website for a dog that you thinks suits you too!

‘A dog for you’ will be a greyhound or lurcher currently in our care who is looking for a loving home.

‘A dog for you’ can suit a range of people with sighthound experience from the novice to the experienced home (experienced homes always very welcome!)

‘A dog for you’ can fit a wide range of living arrangements, but especially popular are rural or semi-rural locations.

‘A dog for you’ will suit your family situation. Whilst some of our dogs can live with children and/or other dogs, many struggle to live with children under 10, or small breed dogs (the latter mainly relating to ex racing greyhounds)

‘A dog for you’ is unlikely to be able to live with cats (or there will be a longer wait)

‘A dog for you’ should be not be expected to have lived in a home before (although some of our dogs may have done)

‘A dog for you’ MAY never be allowed to be let off the lead in a public place due to the natural instinct of the breed.

‘A dog for you’ will need to meet you at our kennel location in Devon, although we occasionally have other dogs which will be homed direct from their current home which could be based in Devon, Dorset, Somerset or Bristol. This may be just the once, or multiple times (depending on the dog).

If you apply for ‘a dog for you’, we will hold onto your application for 3 months, we will review it as new dogs become available. We will contact you to talk through your situation and requirements if we feel we have a match for you, but please, please … keep an eye on the website and apply for a dog if you are interested in them, and think you could be a match. It helps us to speed up the process as we have lots of home offers coming in each week.

Please note, if you have a particular request for a ‘type’ of dog, or fall into some of the categories above that may present a challenge in finding you a suitable dog, we will still happily accept your application as we do get dogs to suit all circumstances. However, it must be accepted that there is a much longer waiting list for these types of dogs. Also in very high demand are small sized, or long coated lurchers.",09/15/2025

About Belle

Beautiful Belle is a lurcher girl of around 7-years-old, looking for a new family due to a change in circumstances at home. Belle has been a much loved family pet for the past six years; her family have made the difficult decision to rehome her, with her best interests in mind.

Belle is very well-behaved inside the home (with the exception of a bit of counter-surfing!) and although she loves her walks, she’s content to snooze for most of the day. She absolutely loves people and is really affectionate and loving. She’s also very welcoming with visitors to the home. Belle is friendly with children, but can be a bit too enthusiastic for very small youngsters! Belle is comfortable with spending around four hours alone at home, though this would need to be built up again gradually in a new environment. She travels well in the car, and generally walks well on-lead; though she will suddenly lunge if she spots a cat or squirrel.

Belle is very friendly with other dogs—including smaller breeds—and has previously shared her home with another dog. She absolutely loves making new friends and can get quite excited when meeting them! Before arriving in our care, Belle had started to show a bit of frustration on walks when encountering unfamiliar dogs, sometimes barking or lunging. This seemed to stem mostly from Belle not getting the level of exercise she was used to! So far in kennels, this hasn’t been an issue. Her adopters may need to give her some extra support around new dogs to start with, but this should improve as long as her exercise needs are met.

Homing Needs

Could live with another dog pending introductions, or as the only pet.
Could live with children, as long as they’re comfortable around medium sized dogs
Needs either a secure garden OR access to a secure field/other safe area
Can be left home for up to 4 hours at a time.",09/15/2025

About Buck

Buck’s happy face reflects his personality perfectly! This larger-than-life lad throws himself into everything with enthusiasm. At just 3 years old, he’s a fun and confident boy who’s always ready for the next adventure.

One of Buck’s favourite things is travelling — he gets so excited when it’s time to jump in the van and is always eager to explore new places. He’s a sociable hound who loves meeting people, happily soaking up fuss and attention from anyone who passes by. He really is a love bug!

On his walks, Buck is generally easygoing and enjoys the company of other Greyhounds or dogs of a similar size. He’s shown polite behaviour with familiar smaller dogs too, although he can get a bit overexcited when he first sees them, so he’ll need adopters happy to continue helping him with calm greetings. Like many Greyhounds, Buck does have a strong prey drive around small furries, so he’ll need confident adopters who can manage him on lead and give him safe opportunities to enjoy the world around him.

Buck would be a wonderful match for an active couple looking for a loyal, fun companion to share in life’s adventures. His big heart and love of life are sure to bring plenty of smiles to his new home — his zest for life really is infectious!

Homing Needs

Could live with older children, pending introductions.
Could share his home with another Greyhound (preferably female), or be happy as the only dog.
Will need patient adopters to help him gradually build up to being left alone.
Best suited to active, confident adopters who can manage a strong, enthusiastic dog on walks.",09/15/2025

Further information will be given when homing Coco. Please note, this support is only available for dogs adopted from Forever Hounds Trust.

About Coco

Beautiful Coco is a medium-sized lurcher who is full of life & looking for her forever home. Coco has previously spent a week in a foster home, where she was clean inside the house and really took a liking to the sofa! Coco absolutely loves people, food and playing with toys. She’s a real character who does everything with plenty of enthusiasm! Although she’s an intelligent and active girl, Coco isn’t constantly on the go and loves to snuggle up for a snooze. Coco can be worried about unfamiliar dogs on walks, and needs to be given plenty of space from them in order to feel comfortable. Coco has done really well with her training and is very rarely reactive towards dogs on walks, as long as she isn’t pushed beyond what she can cope with. With proper introductions she can easily make friends with other dogs and join them for walks. Sharing her home with another dog has not worked out for Coco previously, for a number of reasons – so she will need to be the only pet in her new home.

Coco’s homing needs

A fully secure garden to play in (6ft fencing)
Walks in areas without too many dogs, especially off-lead dogs who might approach her (rural areas or suburban road walking are ideal)
Children 15+
Gradual build-up to any time alone
Adopters willing to carry on her simple training plan around other dogs
Plenty of physical exercise and mental enrichment
Access to a comfy sofa!
No other pets at home & no visiting pets
Adopters physically able to handle her on walks, as she can pull quite hard when excited

If you’d like to offer Coco a space on your sofa, please get in touch!

Further information will be given when homing Diesel . Please note, this support is only available for dogs adopted from Forever Hounds Trust.

About Diesel

Diesel is a very bright and active 6-year-old lurcher boy, who has come into our care as he was very worried by the young child in his previous home. He’s a really affectionate and loving dog with adults, keen to snuggle on the sofa or lean in for fuss. He’s happy to accept visitors into his home and meet new people on walks. Diesel is very smart and picks up training easily! He enjoys spending time with his handler, has a excellent check in and loves to play. He’s house-trained and very well-behaved at home, but does thrive on human company and isn’t comfortable being left alone for long periods. Diesel can be anxious around unfamiliar dogs. He prefers to keep his distance and avoid conflict, but may react by lunging and barking if he feels threatened or overwhelmed. He can make friends with calm, polite dogs if given very gradual introductions, but is much more of a people-person!

Homing Needs

An adult only home, with no visiting children (or plans to have children in future!)
To be the only dog

About Flo

Lovely Flo is a 4-year-old greyhound girl, looking for her forever home. She can be a little shy when first meeting new people, but comes around very quickly. Once she gains confidence, she is very bouncy and enthusiastic! She enjoys fuss and attention. Flo walks well with other hounds, as well as with other breed dogs of a similar size to herself, and interacts very nicely with them. She does find smaller breeds slightly confusing at the moment – she will generally ignore them when passing by on walks, but can sometimes struggle to interact with them appropriately when allowed to greet. Her social skills have already improved since her arrival, but she will need care around smaller dogs as her socialization continues. Flo has gained a lot of confidence since arriving in our care, and now really enjoys going for walks in different places! She is likely to return to her initial shyness whilst she adjusts to the home environment, so will need patient adopters who will let her settle in at her own pace.

Big, beautiful Odin is a friendly and fun-loving youngster. At just 3 years old, this curious and confident lad is always ready for an adventure. He’s already enjoyed several off-site trips in the van, happily exploring new sights, smells, and environments.

Odin adores meeting new people — he’s never shy about saying hello and is quick to lap up any fuss and treats on offer. Out on walks, he’s a real gentleman, happily strolling alongside other hounds and dogs of a similar size, and showing polite, friendly manners when meeting smaller dogs too.

Like many Greyhounds, Odin has a strong prey drive when it comes to small furries, so he’s looking for adopters who can confidently handle a big dog on walks, especially while he’s settling in. He would be best suited to a home without visiting cats, hedgehogs, or other small animals.

Given time to settle and find his feet, Odin will reward his new family with endless love, loyalty, and a big heart — the perfect companion for outdoor adventures and cosy evenings alike.

Homing Needs

Could live with older children, pending introductions.
Could live with another hound, or be happy as the only dog.
Like any new Greyhound, Odin will need to gradually build up to being left alone.
Needs active, confident adopters who can manage a strong dog on walks.",09/15/2025

About Polly

Polly is an active and outgoing greyhound girl, who loves meeting new people and dogs! She’s a bouncy and bright girl who enjoys plenty of fuss and attention. She’s a big fan of spending time with other hounds, and is learning to control her enthusiasm about making friends with different breeds – but this is a work in progress. Polly is being treated for lower back pain as a result of her racing career so would prefer adopters that can build up her exercise gradually and take it especially slow on cold and wet days!

Homing Needs

Could live with teenagers
Needs to be the only hound in the home
Would prefer a rural or suburban area
Needs a gradual introduction to short periods alone, and is likely to get bored if left for too long
Ideally would have a home where she doesn’t need to worry about going upstairs – a bungalow would be perfect !

About Tiger

Tiger is a beautiful 7 year old lurcher girl who is now looking for a new forever home due to a change in her family’s circumstances. She has grown up in a loving home since she was a puppy and is a sensitive, clever, and playful companion who enjoys both her exercise and her downtime — most of her day is happily spent snoozing on the couch!

Tiger has previously enjoyed the company of other dogs she had been carefully introduced to, but can feel a little worried around unfamiliar dogs when out on walks, and may react if approached too quickly. She can also feel unsure around new people at first, but with calm & steady introductions she can learn to make new friends and show her affectionate and loving side.

In her previous home Tiger was used to being left alone for 4 hours, though this has been built up gradually and will need to be gently re-established in her new home. She’s looking for a patient, understanding adopter who can offer her a calm and quiet home where she can feel secure and loved.

Tiger’s Ideal Home

Secure garden
Calm, quiet home with a steady routine
Quiet walking areas, ideally rural or low-traffic, where she won’t encounter off-lead dogs
Someone home most of the time, building up to 4 hours alone
Adopters able to visit her multiple times to help her settle

If you can offer Tiger the peaceful home she deserves, please do get in touch!

KRISSY,"<div class=""photo"" style=""background-image:url(https://rushtondogrescue.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0720-scaled.jpeg);""></div>",https://rushtondogrescue.co.uk/dogs/krissy/,Age: 2 years,Gender: Female,Breed: Staffie,,TA10 9BE,Rushton Dog Rescue,"About KRISSY

Krissy, she has had such an awful life until we saved her. She has been beaten, kept in a shed, forced into pregnancy then discarded just hours before she was due to give birth. 

We took Krissy in as an emergency to ensure her and her puppies safety. Within hours of arriving she went into labour and delivered her puppies. Sadly with Krissy being extremely stressed, poor condition she was unable to care for her puppies, we took over the care fully and hand reared them. This meant Krissy could recover from her abuse without any added pressure. 

Krissy soon realised that she was indeed safe, she was being fed, loved, respected and treated for her awful skin. Krissy is now looking super healthy and happy! 

Krissy would love to find her forever home, she is due to be spayed in the next few weeks then after recovery she will be able to be adopted, until then we would love to have her perfect home lined up waiting for her. 

Krissy does have trust issues, with men. She goes into absolute fear, shakes, runs, trembles and can’t even make eye contact, we know it was a man who abused her mainly so this is not a surprise, however with women she is much for comfortable, she gets on with all us ladies here and is super loving, Krissy is going to need a special home, a home with a lady… We do not and won’t not put her in a situation that is going to cause her stress. It’s not fair. 

Krissy is super with her playing, she absolutely loves toys!! More the better and she would spend hours playing with you throwing her balls, watching her run. She is super fast when she comes out for her free running and her little face just beams! 

The other favourite thing of krissys is food! Food is life, she just can’t get over that she’s fed every single day, and treats.. oh they are just the best! 

Krissy is going to need a home with good sized secure garden, her home is going to have to be pretty rural so she doesn’t have to walk out in busy areas, she wouldn’t cope with that.. too many people too much stress for Krissy. 

Krissy would be best as an only dog as she has never shared her space with another as far as we are aware ( apart from when she was forced to breed) the thing is with Krissy when she has her person then that person is her safety, she deserves to have that all to herself and we believe she will be much happier as she can have all the toys in the world all to herself! 

Krissy is going to need an experienced adopter, an adopter with a calm, chilled environment with no pressure, a home where she can take every day at a time, learn that her new environment is safe and all hers. 

Krissy is such a lovely girl who never deserved all she has had to endure but her future is going to make up for that, her special safe home will be out there somewhere.",09/15/2025

The puppies were born here at freedom farm, we saved their mother “Krissy” who is a staffie cross from a very bad environment, she was being thrown out heavily pregnant and we saved her just hours before she gave birth. Krissy found the whole experience very challenging as she herself was very traumatised from her abusers, we have hand reared the puppies from 1.5 weeks old.

A little about Pink Floyd- He’s such a sweet boy, Floyd was a little behind his bros at first, took him some time to catch up but he did! He was always the smallest out of his brothers but he’s a fab size now and isn’t much smaller than the rest! Floyd is very loving, he is a little more reserved than the rest we’d say but equally still a full on pup! We think he would suit being a companion for an adult dog as he would follow the lead and learn well. When he was a few weeks old we always said he looked like a little fox cub!

Koda is a 5month old Husky pup who is looking for an experienced stable forever adoptive home. 

Koda hasn’t had the puppy hood that he should have had, he should be settled into his forever home now but instead he’s already in a rescue up for adoption. This is absolutely no fault of Kodas he is a sweet well behaved boy. 

Koda is fantastic, he is a social friendly pup who is full of happiness. Koda is absolutely stunning with striking looks. 

Koda would need an experienced husky home to ensure they fully understand his breeds needs. 

Koda walks well on his lead for a pup and is non reactive on the lead. We have taken him out in public and he was a dream! 

Koda would love a good sized enclosed garden so he can run and play, he can go with other dogs..would be amazing if he went in a home with his same breed. 

Koda would be best in an adult only environment as he is a pup who is learning and needs the full attention on him. 

Koda really is a sweet well behaved lad who hasn’t caused us an ounce of bother, he also isn’t displaying any signs of separation anxiety. 

Koda truly deserves a settled committed adopter who will cherish him. 

*Koda will be adopted under a neutering contract as he is to young currently for us to castrate before adoption-all resident dogs MUST already be neutered* ",09/15/2025

📅 Date of Birth: 15/12/2024
⚖️ Approx. Weight: 12kg
✅ Full rescue back-up for life provided
🏠 Adoption subject to a home check
Nicole came to us from the pound — a terrified little soul who barked at everything and everyone. She had never worn a lead and was so scared of human touch that she would try to bite when approached.
But Nicole’s story is one of incredible transformation. With time, structure, patience — and lots of love — she began to trust. We brought her into the house to help her feel safe and slowly introduce her to the world. Now, Nicole walks happily on a lead and shares her kennel with five other dogs, playing and enjoying life. She’s still gaining confidence day by day, but her progress has been amazing.
Nicole is looking for a calm and understanding home that will continue to help her blossom.

Lupin has come a long way since arriving with us from the pound, where he didn’t understand what humans—or even other dogs—were! Over time, he’s blossomed into a gentle, loving soul who is ready to find his forever family.
This large, endearing boy has truly captured our hearts at the kennels, and now it’s his turn to shine.
About Lupin:

• Temperament: Quiet, gentle, and affectionate. A true wallflower who shies away from trouble.
• Good with dogs: Lives happily with a female Doberman. Could live with calm female dogs who won’t bully him.
• Around people: Initially unsure how to respond to affection but now knows humans are friends. Needs a calm and loving environment.
• House skills: Walks well on a lead, clean in his kennel, and isn’t destructive.
What Lupin Needs:
• A home with children aged 12+ (he doesn’t enjoy being chased).
• A peaceful garden where he can relax and enjoy sunny days.
• A patient family who will let him plod around in his own time and shower him with love.
Health:
• Neutered, blood-tested (all clear and healthy).

🧸 Male | 10kg | Born: 18/06/2022
Smokey is a quiet, sensitive boy who’s still learning that human hands can mean kindness. He’s unsure around people right now—slow to trust and still nervous when we enter his kennel—but he’s making small steps forward every day. 💔
He came to us along with his friend Carebear after a devastating family situation. When the husband in the household suffered a stroke, the family could no longer cope, and we were asked to help. We were glad to step in.
🐕‍🦺 About Smokey:
• Shy and nervous—still working on building trust with people.
• Happy in the company of other dogs; he lives with a friendly pack of small and medium dogs.
• Shares a kennel with his friend Carebear and others.
• Once on a lead, he walks beautifully and enjoys being outside.
Smokey needs a gentle, understanding adopter who can give him time, space, and kindness. A quiet home with another friendly dog would really help him find his feet. 
With a little patience, Smokey will show you just how much love a rescue dog can give. 🐾

DOB: 08/03/2016 | Weight: ~28kg
Douglas came to us after being rescued from an animal hoarder’s home, where he’d sadly been living in poor conditions. Following the owner’s passing, Douglas and many other Collies were left needing urgent help.
Used as a stud dog, Douglas spent much of his life in isolation, without proper care or socialisation. Understandably, he arrived at AA Dog Rescue anxious, unsure of his surroundings, and initially a little defensive with staff.
But with time, patience, and kindness, Douglas has shown his true colours—and what a sweetheart he is! He now sits on command, offers his paw, and enjoys cuddles from staff. He’s a gentle boy who prefers the company of females dogs but isn’t aggressive toward males—just a bit more cautious and curious.
Douglas walks nicely on a lead and, with continued love and guidance, would likely get along well with both male and female dogs. He really shines when he’s around the ladies!
We would ideally like a Collie or dog experienced home for Douglas.

Hi, I’m Buzz, and I’d love to share my story with you!
I’m 3 years old (DOB: 24.08.2021), and my journey has been full of ups and downs. When I was just a few months old, I was scared and alone in the woods, hungry and unsure of the world. Then a kind man started bringing me food every day, and one day I found the courage to follow him home. I met his two dogs, who became my friends, and for the first time, I felt safe and loved.
But life changed again. The kind man had to move away and couldn’t take me with him. I ended up in a place with other dogs and caring people who have helped me rebuild my trust. I’ve come a long way since then and am now ready to find my forever family.
What Makes Me Special
 • I’m calm, gentle, and affectionate once I feel safe.
 • I love my walks and absolutely adore a cold bath! (The kennel humans even move my big water bowl with me so I can enjoy it wherever I go.)
 • I get along well with other dogs and love both playful and quiet moments.
 • I’m loyal and full of love, just waiting for the right family to share it with.
A Little About Me
 • I walk well on the lead.
 • I’ve made great progress in trusting people.
 • I’m ready to shine in a loving home!
Health Information
 • I’m leish positive, which means I need a daily tablet (don’t worry, it’s affordable).
 • I’m otherwise in good health.
 • I’ve been neutered and have my passport.
I’ve overcome so much, and I dream of having a family who will love and cherish me. If you think you can give me the forever home I’ve been waiting for, please email Homing@aadogrescue.org.uk.
I promise to bring loyalty, joy, and so much love into your life. Let’s start our journey together! 🐾",09/15/2025

📅 DOB: 30/11/2021
Rogan is full of life, love, and energy! He needs not only plenty of physical exercise, but also mental stimulation to keep his bright mind busy. He thrives on human companionship — whether that’s playing with his toys, getting affection, or heading out for lots of walks to burn off that pent-up energy.
For now, Rogan would be best as the only pet in the household. He’ll need time to decompress, settle into his new routines, and feel secure before being introduced to other dogs. He’s not aggressive, just a little over-zealous at times!
His perfect match? An energetic owner or family who enjoys long hikes, outdoor adventures, or dog-friendly sports that combine exercise and brain games. With the right outlet for his energy, Rogan will learn to relax and should eventually be happy being left alone for a few hours.
Rogan is currently food-aggressive around dogs and people, but we’re working on this and he’s already making progress.

Joe is a lively and affectionate 3-year-old boy with a big heart and plenty of energy! He’s a strong, muscular lad, still a little underweight at around 20kg, but we’re helping him get to his ideal size.
Joe absolutely loves people and craves human affection—he’ll make sure the kennel staff know when he’s in need of cuddles! He’s also a big fan of tug toys, treats, and playtime.
When it comes to other dogs, Joe can get a bit overexcited, but he means no harm and shows no aggression. He just needs guidance to help manage his enthusiasm.
Joe does pull on the lead, but once he’s had a good run to burn off some energy, he settles down and walks much better. He needs both physical and mental stimulation, so an active family would be the perfect match for him.

He’s a handsome good natured lad who is currently living outdoors in a kennel so his toilet training will need a bit of fine tuning. Maverick is a live wire and can be giddy and excitable. But he has bags of potential and for a breed experienced owner willing to invest time in his training, he will make a a fantastic and loyal companion.

Whilst Maverick has lived with two other smaller dogs, he is fairly giddy and excitable and outside the home is reactive when he sees other dogs coming his way. Whilst Maverick is a friendly chap his exuberance means that he will jump up and for that reason he needs a home where any children are older teenagers. He could easily knock little ones over in his excitement. He can be strong on the lead initially but after a while settles down and walks well. However a physically strong new owner is an absolute must as he will pull strongly when he sees other dogs.

To adopt Maverick, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.

Letty,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/letty-1.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/letty/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Lovely Letty is new to Homeless Hounds and has gone straight into a foster home, this is what they have to say about her:

Letty is a lovely 15 year old Jack Russell, she has been checked by the vet, who says she is healthy for her age. She weighs 6kgs , which is just above her ideal weight, but the vet advised she should not be overfed or put additional weight on which might put strain on her joints or mobility. Letty does have a tremor that is visible when she is standing still and alert.

She came to Homeless Hounds because of a change in circumstances and is currently living in foster with a spaniel and a schnauzer. She has not been tried with cats or other animals.

 She has a small warty growth on her face which the vet says is benign but to get it rechecked if it starts to grow bigger. The wart is not visible at all under her fur. 

She had her teeth checked and only has about 6 left so has her biscuits slightly moistened. Letty has a good appetite.

She has been vaccinated and had worm and flea treatments. She also had her claws trimmed (as we believe she was not really getting proper walks and has had to learn how to walk nicely on a harness and lead). She loves a walk and is good in the car. Letty has built up her strength and is currently doing half a mile twice a day and is aiming for 3 walks daily. She enjoys walks in the countryside and in town. Letty likes to go to the pet shop because they give her a doggy treat. She visits the garden centre, quiet cafes and quiet pubs. She tends to ignore other dogs we pass. She needs to be on a lead as she cannot hear you recalling her. She ignored the sheep and cows she met but was quite interested in the chickens at the farm.

Whilst she has obviously been house trained, due to her age she does have some accidents inside if I do not pick up on toilet cues from her soon enough. I am making sure she goes in the garden 2 hourly to toilet. She sleeps through a night of 7 hours but anymore and I get up to let her outside.

She can see me from 30 feet away. Letty is hard of hearing but can hear noises like next doors dogs barking or me clapping my hands.

I do not think she has been accustomed to lots of people in the house and she needs a home without children as if startled she can turn to snap. However, with the correct approach for a hard of hearing dog she is fine and no longer does this with us since she has become familiar with us and her new environment.  At the vets she was muzzled because she wasn’t happy when being poked and prodded on the vet table. 

So far she has not been a lap dog, but does like to be with you on the sofa or a cushion on the floor. She can jump onto the sofa but needs a little stool to help her. If sunny she likes to sit in the garden with my husband on the chair next to him. 

Letty can be left for short periods, although we have only done this as a trial as we do not work and basically she is with us all the time.  

To adopt Letty, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.

He is a very easy going boy and happy to fit into your routine -as long as he’s with you he’s a happy boy.

Rico needs to be the only pet – he cannot share his home with cats, dogs or furry pets.

Rico is house trained and lets you know when he needs to go outside. He has not had one accident in his foster home. Rico sleeps at the end of the bed and generally doesn’t move all night unless he needs the toilet. Added bonus he doesn’t snore!

Rico does have separation anxiety and doesn’t like being left alone. This is improving slowly as he becomes more settled and confident. He does bark and howl when left alone. Rico would be ideal for  a home worker or someone around most of the time especially to begin with whilst he settles in his new home.

Rico loves playing fetch and will drop a ball into your hand to encourage you to play. He love’s interactive games tug of war throw etc. He likes treat filled kongs and licky mats. Rico is well behaved around food, both his own food and his human’s food.

Rico loves his walks, out sniffing around but also happy with sofa/duvet times – he really is the best companion. He likes to know what is going on – watching out the window or patrolling the back garden making sure no squirrels trespass! He is an excellent guard dog.

Rico knows most basic commands and is a very quick learner using treats as rewards. He knows sit/stay/come/on/off/toilet/fetch/drop and he will come when called. Rico is a good car traveller.

On walks, he wears a harness and a double ended lead. Rico also wears a muzzle on walks as he is anxious/reactive near other dogs. This is constantly improving when seeing other dogs now and he is a lot less stressed as time has gone on. He walks well on a short lead and is easy to walk around people being obedient and sitting at the kerb.

Rico is happy with long or short walks – he is definitely a fair weathered walker and doesn’t do rain!

Rico is an amazing faithful boy who will make an excellent companion for anyone who can give him the time love and re-assurance.

Emily,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/emily-5.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/emily/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Emily is a little terrier cross of around 4 years of age. She is currently living with one of our lovely fosterers and her older dog and has been very well behaved. This is what her fosterer says about her;

Emily loves all people and all dogs. She is lively and loves to chase the pigeons out of the garden, her recall in the house or garden is good. I haven’t had her off the lead as I back onto a wood full wonderful smells which she relishes on an extended lead but I’m sure when she has settled completely in a new home she will be able to be let off a lead.

Initially she slept on my bed as she barked when left at night but last night she decided to sleep on a blanket I had left on the floor, again with time she would probably sleep downstairs. She pulls on a lead but only weighs just over 3 Kg so is manageable.

Emily’s fosterer thinks that Emily’s perfect home would be with a younger retired couple who love walking who preferably have a resident neutered dog for companionship for Emily. We are also told that she is small, very quick and darts around getting under your feet so she is best not being rehomed with a more elderly person as she would be a trip risk. It’s also felt that Emily would not tolerate being left for long periods of time- so far in the company of another dog she has tolerated being left for 2 hours but longer periods could be built up slowly. She’s also very lively and full of fun but has a strong prey drive so no cats or small furries please.

You can still apply for this beautiful girl but be aware, at this stage we don’t know which type of home she will require.

We have limited information but what we do know about Basher is:
She is a sweet girl and is not dog friendly. Basher is strong on the lead but soon settles. She also loves to give gentle kisses to her human. When we re-home Basher, if there are children in the household we would be looking for the children to be 12 + years old, due to her being an energetic and bouncy girl, she could easily knock over a small child.

Meet Sally our Cocker Spaniel who is approximately 3 to 4 years old. She is a lovely girl who is very friendly and loves attention. She is house trained and is also dog friendly. Being a Spaniel, she has a lot of nervous energy and will require a family who can provide not only exercise but plenty of time and patience to train her and help build her confidence.

She has only spent a few days in foster (September 12th) but she has settled and is starting to relax. She knows sit and place commands. She walks really well on the lead and doesn’t pull. She can be left at home for short periods, she initially cries but then settles. The fosterer will continue to work on this.  Her favourite toy is her ball and she loves to play games. In the evening after a busy day she will settle and relax with you.
Can you give Sally her perfect home?

Winston,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/profile-1.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/winston/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Winston is a 3 year old medium-large sized crossbreed who has come in to us due to a change of circumstances within the home which Winston is finding difficult to cope with. He needs a home with a physically capable owner and one where he will get plenty of exercise and training. We ask all applicants to note that Winston cannot live with young children. Winston generally behaves like a big goofy puppy and needs to be kept stimulated . He is very affectionate and loves cuddles, fusses and will lean in to his favourite humans.

He is also very intelligent and would be best suited to a calm adult only house or one with mature teenage children with plenty of time for him and but above all he needs people willing to invest in his training. Winston is very gregarious and likes to introduce himself to everyone he meets. He likes to visit the pub and will happily lie down and chill out whilst his owners relax. Whilst Winston is delightful with older humans, Winston has not adapted well to a new toddler in his home as he likes his own space to be respected and is uncomfortable with loud unexpected noises.

Winston is generally dog friendly with dogs of all sizes and has bags of energy. The only dogs he appears to dislike are German shepherds and huskies following an incident when he was attacked by one. He gets on very well with labradors and loves playing with a friend’s staffy. Winston loves his toys and suckles on his favourite teddy! Winston does not like to see arguments between his humans and can be quite protective of the person he feels the anger is directed at. As a result of that if there are any arguments in the house now he will be protective of the person that he feels anger is directed at. Winston needs a very calm home environment.

Whilst his basic training is in place this needs a lot more work. He will sometimes sit on command and will give either paw politely once sat. He’s very strong on the lead – pulls like a train due to excitement of going out but he is responsive if you talk to him, he wants to engage. Again this is more a training issue and with the right input he will learn quickly although he’ll always be excitable! He can walk on a loose lead but only when he’s heading home. At present,he has offlead time in a nearby field but applicants need to be aware that his recall is zero if he sees other dogs or people. He is extremely friendly but nosey and will run right over to other people/dogs and will try to jump up.

Since he’s a big lad this can come over as intimidating and therefore any new owner will need to be mindful of this. He’s very nervous with louder sounds when out and about – motorbikes, trains trucks, tractors etc but for some reason loves fireworks. He’s clean in the house and non destructive. He can be left for periods of up to 4 hours at a time without any issues.

Applicants need to be aware that Winston does not like either vets or groomers and will have to muzzled on all visits. Health wise he occasionally limps on one back leg but the vets have investigated this and determined that he is not in need of any treatment and they’re happy to leave him as he is. Maybe request vet record to get full picture? On one of his stays with a home boarder, Winston lived on a farm for a week where there were horses, chickens and free roaming cats plus a cat living in the house. Winston didn’t bat an eyelid at any of them so he may be suitable for homing with a cat.

Mr Wobbles the warrior is a three legged superstar staffy. He’s a lovely boy who doesn’t let his missing leg hold him back. He’s a dream in the car, you don’t know you’ve got him. He takes food gently and likes to sit on your feet for cuddles.

He has lived with another dog before and possible could again with careful introductions. He’s about 6 years old and knows basic commands. He does pull a little bit on his lead but not unmanageable.

Cookie,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/profile-2.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/cookie/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Cookie has recently been in foster and this is what her foster mum has said about her.

Cookie is a lively and affectionate dog with a lot of love to give. She bonds closely with her people and thrives on attention, companionship, and playtime. She’s intelligent, eager to please, and has a goofy, puppy-like charm that brings joy to those around her. She’s great at cuddles, loves one to one time, and has a playful side that emerges once she feels safe and secure. Cookie is very food orientated, and although she is getting better at this you do need to watch your fingers, especially if there’s other distractions (or it’s her favourite treat). She is also sensitive to grains and meat fed on grains in her food, so the vets have suggested dog food with salmon/lamb to avoid any allergic reactions.

Cookie thinks play time is the best time, and her high energy personality makes her perfect for someone who loves the outdoors and can take her for regular exercise – her favourite place so far is the beach! The excitable personality does sometimes lead to Cookie jumping up or not listening intently to commands, so ideally she will go to a household with people who are able to train this out of her and no young children, as she’s a strong lady and may jump up.

Cookie is a very warm hearted and affectionate character, and she deserves a loving home surrounded by people who look at her the way she looks at you. She shows affection by bringing you pillows, sitting herself on your knee and planting her soft lips on your face! She can be a little pushy with her love, especially when other dogs are involved, so we would like her to be rehomed as an only dog. However, outside the home on walks and inside the home for shorter periods of time she’s proven to be great with other dogs, thoroughly enjoying playing and saying hello to everyone she meets.

Cookie is still finding her feet, and needs reassurance and positive nurturing to become her true self, especially in new situations. She can be left alone for short periods, but has proven to be a little destructive on occasion so we advise walks beforehand and fun toys to distract her. She is house trained but does have accidents in new environments, but again with reassurance this will pass. Everyone who meets her loves Cookie, she aims to please and is hours and hours of endless fun and enjoyment. She really does deserve the very best, and will prove to be one of the greatest, funniest, most loving dogs you will ever meet.

Echo,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/echo-2.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/echo/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Echo is a beautiful, kind and gentle but energetic Saluki lurcher, she is approximately 3 years old. She is very scared of all people and bolts to get away. She LOVES all other dogs and would like a canine friend in her new home who will run around with her and give her the confidence she lacks around people and out and about on walks. She really does want to be with people and can be easily handled (once caught!) But is very frightened by close contact. She is house trained but does have ‘accidents’ if left alone too long or frightened by loud noises etc. She would like a new home with calm people who have lots of patience and a regular routine. I don’t think she’d do well living with children as sudden fast movements really frighten her and so does lots of noise.

She is very spooked out on a walk and tries to run away from things that frighten her so won’t be able to be let off the lead. She has low prey drive and good food manners. She would love a large garden in her new home with lots of room for her and her new doggie friend to chase around in. It would need very secure high fencing with no escape holes as at first, whilst still settling in she will try to escape when she’s frightened, she likes trees and bushes to hide behind so she can watch people without being too close. When you have eventually gained Echo’s trust she tolerates being stroked and I think one day she’ll grow to really enjoy it. With the company of another dog she will settle down on the sofa as long as people sit still and aren’t too close. In time Echo will make the right person a loyal companion and will enjoy playing games with them too.

Florence is currently in foster care. She has settled in quickly and is a soft gentle girl. She is fully house trained and can be left home alone for a couple hours with no issues. Flo enjoys playing with her toys. Flo is happy to meet visitors and definitely encourages them to stroke/cuddle her. She’s a lovely gentle girl looking for her forever home.

Florence is a beautiful, affectionate girl who will do anything for a treat. If she sniffs out treats in your pocket, she will nudge your pocket and give you the big puppy dog eyes until you give in. Although we think she is partially deaf, she is well trained and knows lots of commands, such as sit, paw and wait. She loves to be kissed and cuddled and craves human contact. If you want a dog to snuggle with on the sofa in the evenings, Flo’s your girl.

Florence sometimes barks whilst out walking to let everyone know she’s around. We think this is just excitement and feel this will subside as she gains confidence and stability in a routine. Florence can be quite strong on the lead and pull a bit initially, but once she calms, she walks nicely.

Unfortunately Flo is not dog friendly and will have to be the only dog in the home.

You can still apply for Fudge but be aware at this stage we don’t know what type of home he will require.

Fudge is a big bundle of love. He absolutely loves human interaction and is always eager to please. Fudge is a young boy who is looking for someone to share adventures with, followed by a cuddle on the sofa. He is strong on the lead, but we are sure his lead manners will improve quickly with some training.

When Fudge came to us, we were told that he wasn’t dog friendly, however we are monitoring this closely and working on it. Fudge can be reactive to other dogs that walk past his kennel, but when in the outdoor run and on walks this is less apparent. We are looking for a home where Fudge would be the only dog, but do feel his dog social skills could really improve with work and training. Fudge is a typical labrador cross when it comes to food! He is highly motivated by a tasty treat which will be a great tool when it comes to continuing his training. He enjoys destroying soft toys but will happily settle chewing tougher toys and bones which help him calm.

Fudge is always very welcoming to both familiar and unfamiliar people, he greets them with a smile and a waggy tail! Fudge is still a pup at heart so would be best suited to a home that has the time to build on his training and manners, you can be sure to be thanked with lots of love in return.

Des is an absolute star. He is toilet trained in the home. He will do anything for a treat and so will be easy to train moving forward. He is gentle in nature but if he has the zoomies due to his size, its best to move out of the way! He will grow into a large strong dog so people with large breed experience are needed for this very handsome chap. The pictures don’t do him justice he is beautiful and graceful. He loves his food, and he comes back to you for a cuddle after every meal.

He presently sleeps in our bedroom beside our bed but sometimes takes himself downstairs to sleep on the sofa. He will make someone the perfect family member. He listens to instructions, he is eager to please and he is very playful around other dogs. But he is not fond of cats. He walks beautifully on the lead and doesn’t pull. One good walk a day and some stimuli in the home and he is basically a couch potato who likes his naps.

Whilst I haven’t left him alone yet, I think as long as he has had a walk, then he will settle down to the sofa or a soft bed and be fine for a couple of hours. Hes not clingy in the home and really is the perfect companion. He is a big softy with a huge heart who thinks he’s a lapdog too.

Boris,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/boris-5.jpg,https://homelesshounds.org.uk/boris/,,,,,FY5 5LR,Homeless Hounds,"Boris has been at Homeless Hounds for a short time and has become a firm favourite with our volunteers. He recently spent a short time in a foster home to recover from an operation and he proved to be such a good boy in the home. He also loved the couch that much he was named the couch potato!

Boris is a very lovely, sweet natured boy. He loves to play with a ball and gentle tug of wars with rope toys, but doesn’t snatch toys. He knows all the basic commands, including: ‘sit’, ‘paw’, ‘lie down’, ‘wait’ and when he’s playing with a ball, if you say ‘drop’, he drops it at your feet. He also walks nicely on the lead, but can show interest when he sees other dogs. Some dogs he reacts to and some he doesn’t, so for this reason, we feel Boris should not be re-homed with other dogs.

In enclosed, secure areas, when he is off lead, his recall is great and he responds to “Boris, here!” He enjoys playing fetch and likes to please. He also has a very affectionate side and bonds quickly with those who spend time with him. He’s a little underweight at the moment, so we’re working on getting him to a healthy weight. Boris has a medium energy level, he would require at least one or two good walks a day and some play time, but he will also chill and roll on his back for belly rubs. Overall, he’s a lovely, intelligent boy and would thrive in a stable home environment.

He’s a strong boy with bags of energy and would love to have a garden to run around in to burn off some of that energy. He can be boisterous at times and he would enjoy living in a home where there is plenty of activities to keep him stimulated. He has lived with another dog and has been very happy to have canine company.

He doesn’t seem to get possessive over toys or his owner’s attention but he can be rather clumsy which some other dogs might find rather annoying. He can walk very well on a lead but does tend to pull quite strongly at times particularly to inspect interesting looking lampposts! He can also get very excited when he sees other dogs out and about and he will vocalise his excitement at some volume particularly when he is out walking with another doggie companion.

Baxter is a very obedient boy and knows basic commands. He’s eager to please, very responsive to training and has bags of potential for an owner with the time to train him. Baxter doesn’t like sleeping in a crate and is able to successfully head butt the door open to find his owner! For this reason, he has been used to sleeping in his fosterer’s bedroom. Baxter isn’t keen on being left alone so ideally he is best in a home where his owner is around for most of the time. Despite his fosterer’s best efforts to integrate Baxter with her cats, this has not been entirely successful. We would therefore not place Baxter in a home where there are resident cats.

She walks fairly well on the lead and is very manageable. She knows basic commands and is quick to please and earn the praise of her humans.

She would love a home with an understanding garden in which she could work off any excess energy. Outside the home, Trixie is selective with other dogs. She is happy to walk past some dogs without blinking an eyelid. She is reactive to others and is not comfortable around other dogs in confined spaces. Therefore she needs an owner who is happy to exercise Trixie in quieter areas and on a lead at all times. She is not a dog that is comfortable walking in areas where there are other off lead dogs that may bound up to her. Further advice will be given to any interested applicants.

Stan is a perfect house guest – he is house trained, obedient and fantastic company. He loves attention and is incredibly affectionate and loving to all humans. He likes children but can jump up at times so he is best rehomed where any children are over 10.

He might unintentionally knock little ones over in his excitement to get to know them better. In this respect Stan would benefit from more training. His favourite hobbies are playing with his toys, sitting in the garden in the sun, relaxing on the settee and going for as many walks as are offered. He is currently getting one hours walk in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon. He likes to sleep on his owner’s bed and of an evening will take himself off to bed and sleep undisturbed all night ( preferably under the quilt in winter!)

He can be left for around 4 hours without any problems. He may fret if he was left any longer than that though. Outside the home whilst Stan loves his walks and walks fairly well on the lead, he does not like other dogs. Whilst he is not reactive to other dogs when he sees them and is happy to keep himself to himself, he hates other dogs bounding over to him and getting in his face. He views this behaviour as a threat and will react adversely when this occurs. Therefore any new owner is advised to walk Stan in quiet places, at quiet times and to avoid any areas where there are offlead dogs that may annoy Stan. Apart from his dislike of other dogs, Stan is almost perfect! Stan is not keen on small furries and cats and therefore he is best rehomed as the only pet.

To adopt Stan, please complete an Adoption Application form and we will be in touch.

Jessie is dog friendly and has previously lived with another dog. Outside the home she is similarly friendly towards other dogs but can be anxious when larger dogs approach her. Jessie can be anxious in new surroundings and it may take her a while to settle in – for this reason she is best in a home where any resident children are older.

She may need help initially with toilet training until she completely settles in to her new home and to a new routine. Jessie isn’t always keen on going out for walks! There are days when she puts the brakes on and decides she would prefer to stay at home. She forms very strong bonds with her owner and would suit somebody retired who is around for most of the day.

We are looking for a quiet home for Jessie with a patient owner and an environment where she has access to a secure garden. Jessie suffers from allergies and these have been successfully treated by the vet but she is likely to need a low maintenance dose of medication to keep the allergies at bay for the rest of her life. Full details of the medication she will need and the likely cost can be supplied to any interested applicant.

Baloo is a big dog, with a big heart! It is an absolute pleasure fostering him. He gets on great with our two resident dogs, he loves playing with them and cuddling up with them. Baloo also takes a lot of confidence from them when out on walks so we think he would be best suited to a home with a dog companion. Baloo can be nervous in new situations and when meeting new people, and shows this by leaning or pulling away. When on walks Baloo can find busy roads and/or lots of people overwhelming but this is something we’re working on with him.

In the home Baloo loves cuddling up on the sofa, playing with his toys (he’s a strong chewer!) and playing with our dogs. He likes to be in the same room as you; he’s great at spotting any spillages while you’re cooking! We also have cats who he gets on well with most of the time. He will occasionally chase them if they’re running but we are working on stopping that. Baloo has also shown that he is good around children, but doesn’t realise quite how big he is so would be better suited with older children that he’s less likely to accidentally knock over! Baloo steals the hearts of everyone he meets, whoever adopts him with be very lucky to have him in their lives.

She is a 13 year old border terrier with a very sweet nature. She   easily bonds with anyone who gives her cuddles and attention. She doesn’t play with toys, but may play ball for a short time, she really is happy and content just to always be near you. 

She has been left on her own for 1-2 hours without incident. She is not demanding and it’s no trouble having her around. She does get upset when someone leaves the room and barks a little but this is short-lived. She sleeps soundly in her own bed in the bedroom as she likes to know you are nearby. 

She had a chronic raspy cough but it is only evident when she is excited or stressed, she is not noisy in her sleep.

Queenie loves people but she does not like any other dogs. She gets very upset and barks loudly when she is out walking and sees one in the distance. For this reason it is best to walk Queenie in quiet times or quieter dog-free areas (as she really does love to get out in the fresh air and have a walk), it is easier to deal with this if she wears a small harness. She travels well in the car as long as she doesn’t see any dogs.

She loves having a bath and a pamper including a towel rub down and a blow-dry with the hairdryer, she will sit contently until she is fully buffed. She eats well and adores chicken as a treat, she is house trained and behaves well in the house.

She is very loyal and affectionate and everyone falls in love with her cute little face.

This is what her foster mummy has to say about her:

Lucy, approximately 2 – 3 years old, Bull Lurcher. Lucy is an elegant all white bull lurcher. Ive had the pleasure of spending time with Lucy, she’s lived in my home for a few months. She’s everything you could want in a pet dog. She has decent recall, eager to please. With a little extra training I think she could even be perfect. Lucy lived in the kennels for too many months. She was literally climbing the walls. Taken out of that environment, she’s the perfect companion.

She loves to play with other dogs. I’ve witnessed no doggie aggression whilst she’s been with me. She does play pretty heavy but she’s a large dog. She loves to run and is a real machine. She’s powerful and moves like lightening. She’s quite giddy and a little skittish at times, as she’s still only young but she follows instruction. She’s very food oriented and I can’t fill her. She loves vegetables and she’s currently on raw food. She’s not picky, however, and will try anything. Especially partial to toast for breakfast.

She rarely barks unless someone knocks on the door but is happy to greet visitors. I wouldn’t encourage anyone to take Lucy if out all day working, she needs company or maybe the company of another dog. I wouldn’t recommend a household with cat(s), although I’ve nothing to back up this statement. On the downside, she’s strong on a lead and has been known to damage the odd dog bed if left alone. She’s a healthy young dog, beautiful short soft coat which sheds a little.

Bizarrely she’s good at self cleaning after a run on a muddy field. Thankfully she doesn’t mind a shower too. Please remember she’s lived in a kennel for months, she’s possibly had a number of homes. It’ll take her some time to settle in her new home as it would you or I. Don’t give up on her, she’s worth it! She’ll bring you joy. I challenge you to look in her eyes and not fall in love.

He is very sweet and affectionate with the people he knows and trusts and is usually indifferent about other dogs. The way to win Rocco over is to walk him – he gets so excited to go for a walk and if he has that positive association of walking with you, he’ll be your best pal.

Rocco sometimes displays some guarding behaviours in his kennel, particularly with strangers, but our volunteers have been working with him on this and he has made huge progress. Strategies to deter this behaviour can be advised to potential owners. 

As a typical shar pei, Rocco can come across quite stand offish and aloof initially, but once you get to know his personality, there is such a loving side to him and he would make a very loyal companion. 

On a walk, he can initially be quite strong on the lead and walks as though he’s on a mission! However, in open areas that are suitable, he enjoys having some freedom on a long lead. Off lead, he likes to do his own thing and explore, but has developed good recall and will return to those he is familiar with.

He has patiently waited a long time for someone to give him a chance, but always gets overlooked. If you think you could give Rocco the loving home he deserves, please complete an application form.

Beautiful Lucy has been at Homeless Hounds for 6 weeks now and she is thriving in her foster home.

This is what they have to say about this beautiful girl:

Lucy is a lurcher X approximately 7 years old. At the time of writing this (December 8th) we have been fostering Lucy for two weeks. When she arrived, she was in a state of shock but has now really blossomed. Lucy is completely house trained and walks really well on a lead. She loves to be near us and enjoys a fuss but is happy to lie on her bed and snooze. She has some separation anxiety which we’re working on, and we’ve discovered she is happiest left in a crate. Lucy is wary of visitors to the house and particularly men. It takes a couple visits and a few treats for her to relax and interact with our friends & family.

Lucy isn’t keen on small dogs but will happily walk past if there is some distance between them. She is not aggressive, but her fear makes her growl to let them know to stay away. Although she has some challenges we feel these have come from her past life and not because of character. She would be best suited to a quieter household where she will be the only pet and not be left for long periods of time. Perhaps a retired couple or single person. Lucy is a sweetheart who will give so much love to the right home.

Following surgery Arnold spent a couple of days in a foster home, this is what they had to say about this big handsome boy…..

Arnold is a young handsome big lad who loves nothing more than snuggling up to his humans. He sometimes forgets his size and sees himself as a lapdog trying to sit on your knee. Arnold is a big boisterous vocal boy who loves to play with his toys. He sometimes forgets his manners when he meets new people and will jump up. He definitely needs to be the only pet in the home.

Arnold is very loyal to his humans. He is house trained and can be left for up to 4-5 hours home alone. During that time he snoozes and chills out. Arnold loves a car ride and travels well. Arnold enjoys his walks – he shows reactivity on the lead and requires continued training help with this.

Arnold is a lovable character who would best suit an adult only pet free home.

Jinx has returned to Homeless Hounds through no fault of her own and is ready to go into her new home.

Jinx is a special girl who requires alot of attention from her owner. Due to her breed we are looking to rehome Jinx to someone or family with older children who have experience with an active dog. This girl will keep you going all day if she has chance, Jinx is a very intelligent girl who needs lots of stimulation, but on the flip side she also loves cuddles and is also very affectionate.

Jinx is finding it frustrating being in the kennels, and when she is greeted by our volunteers who are going to take her on a walk, she can be quite mouthy to begin with, but in a playful kind of way. While on her walks she responds well to positive feedback and of course a treat. She knows basic commands and when another dog is passing by she shows interest, and sometimes barks, but not in an agressive way, it’s like she wants to interact with the other dog.

Jinx would be better suited in a home where she can flourish and become part of her own family again. To adopt or foster Jinx fill in an application below.

This is what we know so far:

Elegant Heidi is a sensitive soul who needs a loving home. We’re not sure of her past, but she seems to be wary of strangers on a first meet, although this has improved in recent weeks. She can appear feisty when she barks at a stranger who approaches her, but this is clearly just fear and will stop if told, “No.” Heidi needs time to assess you and come to you in her own time. She is a little suspicious of people who try too hard or are overpowering.

However, once she trusts you, she just wants to be cuddled and is so gentle and affectionate. You know you’ve won her over when she drops to the floor and rolls on her back for a belly tickle. We think she may not have been walked much in the past, as she has very soft velvety pads at the bottom of her paws and they seem to be sensitive when walking on concrete, but once she’s on grass she walks fine. Now she is getting daily walks, her pads should harden up and this won’t be a long term issue. She walks beautifully on the lead and responds to her name when called, which suggests she has good recall.

Heidi enjoys playing fetch with a ball and will drop it in front of you to throw again. She has had some training, as she knows some commands such as “sit”, “lie down” and “wait.” Heidi is a very intelligent dog and craves so much love. She just requires a little bit of patience and lots of love and stability. She has all the potential to make a fantastic, loyal companion.

While Heidi is on her walks she has come into contact with other dogs and appears dog friendly. Likewise she has also been in the company of cats. Heidi was good around them initially and didn’t react.

As we get to know more about Heidi, we will update the website, thank you.

Buddy is a special boy who is looking to find his forever home.

In general Buddy behaves well around other dogs and could live with an older, well balanced calm female dog. He can become a little boisterous when playing with his male friends and this can sometimes spill over when he gets carried away. He would suit a family with no children or teenage children. Buddy’s ideal home would be a quiet home with another well behaved dog with no issues and where there aren’t an abundance of visitors. Buddy needs careful introduction to new people who enter his home environment especially tall males, he will approach people and enjoys gentle affection but can become over stimulated and doesn’t enjoy being rubbed around his face and ears but prefers a gentle rub from underneath his chin.

With encouragement buddy will go for short walks but tends to lag behind. His basic obedience is good and he knows commands such as sit and wait and his recall off the lead is generally good even with distractions around. He is crate trained and will go to his bed when asked. He is happy to sleep in his crate overnight and during the day when left alone.

Buddy is fed twice a day and will finish his meal straight away. He enjoys treats as a reward and is particularly keen on a licki mat which also helps him settle down in his crate. He will occasionally play with toys but does enjoy chewing a Nylabone. Buddy will tolerate being groomed and will allow you to touch him head to tail although this should be done once trust has been built up with his new human.

Billy is a lovable 10 month old puppy, who loves being with you and likes to snuggle. We suspect he is a Bocker. A cocker and a beagle. He sleeps well in his crate overnight and can be left for 3 hours if needed. Whilst Billy can be left, he wouldn’t like to be left every day for long periods. He doesn’t chew things around the house and loves his toys, but does love stealing a sock!

Billy needs a home experienced with reactivity, as he’s hasn’t been socialised and hasn’t got much experience with the outside world. The outside world makes him anxious. He is reactive to people, dogs, cars. This includes barking, lunging. With people and dogs he reacts at quite large distances. As a result he has just been going on short training walks and has been regularly exercised in a dog field, as advised by a behaviorist.

Billy is house trained, knows basic commands like sit, down, paw, wait, middle and has been quick to learn. He is great at home and in the garden, but when outside becomes very overwhelmed and does not responded to treats or his name. Billy has been great with my daughter, who is 5, but is very jumpy so some children may not like this. Billy does not like visitors and can become very fearful. Hiding under the sofa – growling and has nipped. But with regular visitors and slow introductions, he does accept them after some initial barking.

Billy loves agility in the back garden, and would love to do more of this – if he can learn to be less reactive to people and dogs. Billy cannot live with cats.

Sex: Female
Age: 1 year
Key information: Friendly, loving and happy girl, loves people and is good with other dogs. Can live with another sighthound but no other pets.

Zara is a friendly girl who will always welcome you with a waggy tail, she loves people and is very affectionate. 

Zara came from a place where she was meant to be a racing Greyhound but luckily for her she has never raced. However due to Zara’s breed she does have a strong desire to chase small furries and does wear a muzzle while out and about on her walks. Zara has no problems with this and thinks of her muzzle as her fashion accessory. 

Zara is a playful girl who enjoys running around, catching her squeaky toys and off course zooming around the garden. After a fun day she loves nothing more than napping on the couch beside you.

Zara is looking for owners who are at home most of the day as she has never lived in a house before. Despite this Zara loves spending time in our office and will happily chill while we work.

"Marley, 4 year old, Greyhound",https://borderspetrescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/marley-4-400x284.jpeg,https://borderspetrescue.org/adopt-a-pet/marley-4-year-old-greyhound/,,,,,TD4 6DJ,Borders Pet Rescue,"Breed: Marley
Sex: Female
Age: 4 years
Key information: Sweet and loving girl, would love to live with another sighthound. Cant live with cats or small furries. Can live with children 12 years or over.

Meet Marley, a beautiful 4-year-old greyhound with a calm, affectionate nature and a heart as soft as her silky coat. She’s sweet, loving, and happiest when she’s by your side, whether pottering in the garden, snoozing on a comfy bed, or chilling out in the office while you work.

Marley is an ex-racing greyhound with a strong instinct to chase small furries, so she wears a muzzle and stays on lead during her walks. Don’t worry though – she’s completely comfortable with her accessories and wears them with ease (and style!).

Marley previously had an old injury which has left her with a little limp. She is on ongoing pain relief, but this doesn’t stop her from enjoying her walks, running around the garden, or playing with her favourite people.

Marley is a gentle soul, though she can be a little wary of men at first and takes time to get to know and trust them. Once she’s comfortable, she’s a loyal and affectionate companion who loves nothing more than being close to her family.

She adores other dogs and feels more confident when she’s around them. Her best friend is a Frenchy cross, and they love taking regular daily walks together.

"Lady, 3 year old Bulldog",https://borderspetrescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lady-1-400x284.jpeg,https://borderspetrescue.org/adopt-a-pet/lady-3-year-old-bulldog/,,,,,TD4 6DJ,Borders Pet Rescue,"Breed: Lady
Sex: Female
Age: 3 years
Key information:  Calm girl who is very friendly and sweet. She does not need a lot of exercise, a garden is a must, can live with children over the age of 12 years old and could possibly live with another dog.

Lady is a sweet, affectionate girl who adores attention, a cosy bed, and simply being by your side. She arrived at Borders Pet Rescue as a stray, so we don’t know much about her past – but what we do know is that she is an absolute star in the office! Lady is happiest when curled up nearby, contentedly snoozing (with the occasional snore!) while you go about your day.

Lady does have some health issues caused by irresponsible breeding. Her very short nose makes breathing difficult, especially in the heat or during exercise. Because of this, she prefers short potters close to home or gentle wanders around the garden. She’s not a dog who enjoys long walks, and she’ll be happiest in a calm environment with minimal physical demands.

Lady also suffers from a condition called entropion, where her eyelashes grow inwards toward her eyes. Thankfully, this can be corrected with surgery, and Borders Pet Rescue will cover the full cost of this operation.

Lady is looking for a quiet, loving home with:

Minimal stairs

A secure garden where she can safely explore

Kind, understanding owners who will cherish her for who she is

She may not be the most energetic dog, but she more than makes up for it in love and loyalty. Lady is gentle, soulful, and incredibly easy to care for. She walks beautifully on the lead, enjoys human company, and always tries her best to please.

She’s searching for someone special who can see beyond her physical challenges and appreciate the truly beautiful soul within. If you’re looking for a devoted, low-maintenance companion who will fill your home with warmth and quiet affection, Lady might just be the perfect match for you.

 

 

if you think you could offer Lady a home, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Age: 2 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Rottie x GSD

Oslo's Notes:

friendly with strangers
is toilet trained
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs

Oslo is a very friendly boy who originally came to us as a stray. He was adopted, but sadly returned due to an incident in the home that Oslo was not at fault for. He is now looking for his forever home and we will provide full support and advice for anyone interested in Oslo.

Oslo is only a young boy and when he first came to us, it was clear he hadn’t had much training and socialisation. We’ve been working closely with him since he arrived and he has improved so much. We would love for his next home to be focused on his training and socialisation because in the right hands he will have a lot of potential. He is very people orientated and treat motivated which is helpful for training! He also loves chasing toys in our off lead paddocks!

He is gen-con trained so he will walk nice, he can be quite strong without the gen-con. He will need an active home that can get him out socialising, with owners that can handle his strength. From the home he was previously in, he was very well behaved, fully housetrained and very friendly with people out and about. He is looking for an adult only home.

Oslo unfortunately is not dog friendly and can be reactive towards them when out and about, when he is handled correctly he is fine passing them and again, is very food motivated which helps with the distraction work that will need to be continued when he goes to his new home.

We hope the perfect family come along for him soon!

Brennin,https://ncar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2521.jpeg,https://ncar.org.uk/animals/brennin/,Age: 2 - 3 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: German Shepherd,,CH8 9BD,North Clwyd Animal Rescue,"RESERVED

Age: 2 - 3 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: German Shepherd

Brennin's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with strangers
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs
can't live with young children

Brennin is a handsome lad who came into our care as a stray after being found tied to a post – due to this we have no background history on him but we have spent time getting to know him and he is now ready to find a new home. He is a nice boy who is friendly with people, he likes playing with tennis balls in our secure on site paddocks and has had some training previously as he knows basic commands and is eager to please.
Due to his breed and long fur he will require ongoing grooming to keep it managable, and he will suit a home with people who have experience with German Shepherds or similar breeds. He is quite a big lad and can be strong on the lead at times so anyone interested in rehoming him must be physically capable of handling him. He can be reactive to other dogs on walks currently and is quite strong when doing so, we will continue to work on this with him here but he really will benefit from getting out of the stressful kennel environment and settled into his new home, we think he will improve much more once he is away from the rescue – Brennin needs a home with people who are committed to him and willing to work with him and help him with his confidence and ongoing training + socialisation.
He is looking for a home as the only pet and due to not having any history on him he is looking for a home without children but does have potential to live with sensible teenagers.
We hope he appeals to fans of the breed and that someone will give him a chance soon.

Rocco's Notes:

friendly with strangers

Rocco is a gorgeous lad who came into our care as a stray, we managed to find out that his owner didn’t want him any longer so he is now looking for a new home. He is a friendly boy who loves people, he can be boisterous at times and will suit a home with people who are used to bull breeds. He is very affectionate, food motivated and generally a happy lad. He loves his walks but due to his breed and stockiness he cannot manage really long walks and does require some extra care in warm weather. He has been good in kennels and is generally quite clean and none-destructive. We have started assessing Rocco around other dogs and will continue to do so during his stay with us – at the moment we feel that he will be best suited to a home as the only pet. He can be rehomed with sensible children 12+ who are confident with dogs. We hope this handsome boy finds a suitable home soon as he has lots of love to give 🙂

Digby's Notes:

Digby is a little sweetie who has come into our care for rehoming due to the child in the home being allergic to him. He has been well loved and is in great condition, he can be a little nervous at times but comes out of his shell quite quickly. He is looking for a lovely home with people who will take him out and about on nice walks as he does love being out. He travels well in the car and is fine to be left alone at home for a couple of hours. He has lived with cats in a previous home and would try to play with them – he does have potential to live with a dog-savvy cat in his next home but they must be confident and the type of cat that will stand up to him as he would be too much for nervous cats. He can be yappy towards bigger dogs but is generally fine with dogs that are a similar size to him, he does have potential to live with a compatible dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue. Digby is looking for a home with children 10+. He is a sweetie who loves cuddles and sitting on your knee, we hope he finds a nice new home soon 🙂

We are expecting him to get quite a bit of interest – Please submit an application form for him and include plenty of detail on your form.

Romeo's Notes:

Romeo is a very handsome boy that came to us as a stray, so unfortunately we have no history on him but he is now looking for his forever home.

Romeo is a friendly boy, who can be quite timid sometimes but quickly warms up to you once he’s had a cuddle! He is very affectionate with you once he knows you and loves playing ball! He can live with children 14+, but this can be reassessed during his stay with us. He’s a typically collie so will need owners that can give him plenty of exercise and attention and will need to be dedicated to socialising and training him.

He can be quite timid with dogs, but settles around them on walks. He can be quite barky initially but does calm down and interacts nicely. We think he does have the potential to chase off lead, we will contuine to assess him while he is with us. We are currently looking for him to be the only dog, but we will contuine to assess while he is with us and this may change with a compatitable dog.

In the right home he has the potential to be an amazing companion, especially for outdoorsy people. We hope he isn’t in kennels much longer as he is a very friendly boy who will thrive in a good home.

Padme's Notes:

friendly with dogs

Padme is a very sweet girl who loves nothing more than cuddles with you! She sadly came to us as a stray so we have no history on her.

Padme is a very affectionate, friendly girl who will need an active home with owners that are dedicated to training. She can be very unsure of dogs and very reactive until she mets them, and then she will happily interact and calm down around them. However, initially she can be barky and very scared, this can escalate if not handled correctly, but she is very treat orientated which does help with her training. She does look towards the handler for guidance and is really responsive to positive praise from the handler. We will continue to assess her while she is with us, and she may have the potential to live with another dog but this may be a lengthy process ensuring both dogs are happy in the home.

With people, she is very friendly and affectionate. She already knows tricks, and will sit, give paw, lie down and even attempts a half roll over! She does walk mostly well on lead, but will be pulley and reactive when she see dogs. She can live with children 16+ but they will have to be involved with her training as she can be a handful on walks.

Padme is a very sweet girl, who is already a favorite with staff but she will need owners that are dedicated to her socialisation and working on her behaviour around dogs. She will need regular walks, mixing with dogs to build up her confidence and showing her the world isn’t so scary.

He is friendly with people and eager to meet you. He is jumpy and excitable so needs to go with owners that can manage his excitable behaviour and put in the work in training him. Please research the breed as he will require a lot of grooming and maintance which can be a monthly expense.

Buddy and lexiare a lovely pair of siblings who are looking for a home where they can stay together as they do rely on eachother.

Buddy and Lexi came to us no fault of their own due to their owners work committments. They have always lived together and play lovely together, so we are looking for a home for them to go together. Buddy is mostly blind so does rely on Lexi to help when out and about. He will need owners will need to take extra care with him on walks etc and it may take him a few days to adjust to his new home and garden. He is mostly quite a confident lad, they both enjoy their walks and sniffing around. We can go into Buddy’s eyesight and give guidence on anyone interested in the pair.

Both can be a little timid when they first meet you but settle well. They have previously had visiting children in the home, but we think they’ll prefer a quiet home where they can plenty of walks and then chill time. They can be rehomed with 15+ children. They are both dog friendly, but tend to prefer their own space. Sometimes Buddy can get intimiated with more vocal dogs but we think this is due to his lack of vision.

We really hope they both find a home soon as they are a lovely pair who are quite confused why they’re in kennels.

Juliet's Notes:

friendly with strangers

can't live with young children

Juliet started as a very timid and sweet girl who came to us as a stray, and is now looking for her forever home where she can have lots of time, space and affection to develop her confidence.

Juliet was found as a stray so we unfortunately have no background information on her. She can be an extremely timid girl who can be scared of sudden movements, loud noises. She clearly hasn’t seen much of the world as she is easily overwhelmed in busy enviornments. She does look towards the handler for guidance but does need time to form bonds with people as she can be initially shy. She is now very friendly with staff and gets excited to see us. However, she can be scared quickly and will need owners that will give her the space she needs, as well as lots of TLC. At the moment, she is looking for a home with 14+, we can reassess this as she gets more confident with us.

We have been testing Juliet with other dogs, she can be very timid and startled if the other dog is too playful, boisterous or vocal. With calmer dogs, she is more comfortable and will try and play, but it is obvious she’s had a very sheltered life as she is very unsure how to initate ‘play’ with dogs, or people. Juliet does have the potential to live with another dog, pending mixes here at the rescue but also she can go as the only dog so she can have all the attention but will need owners dedicated to socialising her. On walks, she can be scared of loud noises etc, on walks and can be quite jumpy on lead. Otherwise, she walks very well on lead and doesn’t leave your side.

She is generally a lovely girl, who is coming out of her shell with us. She will seek us out for cuddles and is slowly learning how to play with toys. We are really hope someone comes along soon as she has so much potential.

Piper is a super friendly girl who came to us as a stray, unfortunately we have no background on her. She is looking for a forever home where she can explore everything!

Piper, nickname Hyper Piper, is a 8month old Collie x Lurcher. Due to her age and breed, she is very energetic and excitable so will need a home that can provide her with lots of exercise and start her training as she has lots to learn! She is very friendly with people and will always greet people with a big hug. She can be rehomed with children 12+ that can get involved with training. She loves her food so this will be a helpful tool with her training.

Piper is good with dogs, but can be timid around larger dogs but so far she shows friendly puppy play behaviours. She does have the potential to live with another dog, pending dog mixes here at the rescue. Her new owners will need to be dedicated to her training and socialising as she does have the potential to be an amazing companion!

She may have some separation anxiety in the home as she does love your company so she’ll be more suited to a home where she won’t be left for long hours.

My name is Yaxley and I am a very sensitive lad looking for nice owners to help guide me :)

Age: 2-3 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Patterdale

Yaxley's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with strangers
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs
can't live with young children

Yaxley is a really sweet boy who came into our care after being found as a stray, he had been loose for a few weeks. It took a while for someone to catch him, so he had a very upsetting beginning when he came to kennels and was understandably bewildered in the new environment. He has now been with us for around a year, and we can’t understand why! He is a typical Terrier and has his quirks, but truly does have so much potential to be great best friend for someone!

He is a friendly boy who loves meeting new people and getting lots of attention! We haven’t had any issues with him regarding being handled and he loves playing in our secure paddocks here at the rescue and can be very playful! He is very affectionate once he knows you and loves playing chase with you with tennis balls.

He is looking to be the only pet in the home as he can unfortunately be reactive towards other dogs when out and about on walks. We have been working with him on this and he is improving slowly, he is learning to interact calmly and he can be quite playful once he is comfortable with the other dog. However, at a distance, he is very barky and can get fixated and it is difficult to distract him at times. We do muzzle him while he is on walks as sometimes he can get nippy when he gets frustrated with other dogs. Once he does interact with a dog, he is much calmer and displays more positive behaviour. This work will need to be continued when he goes to a new home and all advice and guidance will be given by the behavioural team here at NCAR, and we feel that he will improve fairly quickly with the right handler once he is away from all of the dogs + barking here. After spending a few months in kennels and us not having any history of whether he has lived inside a home before he is looking for owners that will be patient with him whilst he settles in and adjusts to his new environment.

Yaxley is looking for an active home and can be homed with sensible teenagers 14+. He has plenty of potential to be a lovely boy in the home, and requires a patient and dedicated owner who understands it will take time to build his confidence.

We really hope that he finds his forever home soon!

Winston (Poo Bear)
Large mix breed, 47kgs
2 years old

Winston came into NCAR as a puppy, went out on foster and was then adopted over a year ago. Unfortunately, due to his owners deteriorating health he needs to find a home more suited to him.

Although he’s a big lad he can walk really well on lead, he knows several commands and is a great lad to have around.
Winston has always lived with other dogs as well as with cats and kittens.
Being really well crate trained he likes to have his little den to go and relax in.

Winston is muzzle trained and head collar trained happy to wear both no problems.
He does enjoy routine and daily exercise and can become a little frustrated if these needs aren’t met, but on the whole he’s a straight forward dog to own.
He likes to play and if allowed to get away with it, can use his size a bit much, not with any bad intentions though. Being the bright lad he is he can soon learn what is acceptable.
He can get excited by visitors but is a smart lad so can learn to show some manners in this situation.
Winston loves being groomed, but he likes to groom you right back with his tongue!
He travels well in the car and is very used to being driven around.

Winston loves his walk and going exploring, very little phases him but he does need guidance around dogs if they themselves are reactive. But he will sit for rewards in most situations if he’s asked to.
He’s not a lazy dog so will suit a home where good daily exercise is the norm, he also like to use his brain to learn and train!

Winston is a very affectionate dog, he loves contact and cuddles, he’s basically a big baby!
If you think you can offer this big lovable lad a fantastic home fulfilling life, then put an application in for him.

Biscoff's Notes:

friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers
is toilet trained
can't live with young children

Biscoff is a lovely boy who came to us as a stray, he was adopted out but sadly returned due to his behaviour in the home.

Biscoff is a very friendly boy who will greet everyone with a big hug. He is good with dogs, but can be quite excitable and jumpy. He does have the potential to live with another dog, but preferably a calm dog that can put up with Biscoff’s bouncy nature. On walks, he does pull occassionaly but does settle and walk nice. Due to his bouncy nature, he is looking for a home with older teenagers.

In the home, his issues were due to seperation anxiety, and he would struggle to be left on his own. He would settle within the same room but would get upset and destructive when left alone. He would also get overexcited and start with some mouthing behaviours. We can give advice and support anyone interested in Biscoff, but he would need a home where he won’t be left for long periods, and with people that are willing to work with him and can help with his training and build up his tolerance to being left alone.

Biscoff would take some time to settle in the car, but travelled really well and enjoyed playing in the garden, and learnt that he liked tennis balls!

Generally, he is a very insecure boy who has had quite a few stressful months since being found as a stray. He will need a calm home where he can learn to settle and show all his true potential.

Casper's Notes:

is toilet trained
can't live with young children

Casper is a very sweet boy who originally arrived as a stray. He did find a home but was sadly returned due to his behaviour.

Casper previously lived with another dog, and he was great in the home. He did have some separation anxiety after being left after so many hours, but generally he was very well behaved. He was completely housetrained, settled well at night, playful with toys and well behaved with the other dog. However, his problems show when he’s on walks. He is a very insecure boy who is easily frightened on walks, therefore he is a big flight risk. He does have bad recall, so he will not be suitable to be let off lead in unsecure places. He is also reactive to other dogs and timid of strangers, this was similar behaviour to when he first arrived with us as a stray.

When he originally arrived at the rescue he was very timid, shut down and took a while to settle with staff and the environment. We spent a lot of time working up his confidence outside and around new people. Simple things like putting the lead on him can make him scared. He was reactive to dogs then but would be more comfortable and show signs of play with calmer dogs. In the home, Casper was very good and playful with the other dog. We will continue to assess him but since returning to kennels, he is very unsure and frightened of dogs at the moment. Anyone interested in him will have to come for several mixes to ensure the dogs are compatible, but equally we will consider a home where he can work on his confidence as the only dog.

He is just a very anxious and timid boy who requires lots of patience and training. He’ll need a home with someone that can teach him the world isn’t as scary as he thinks. A quiet home with minimal visitors, in a quiet area will suit him most. He generally walks well on lead unless he is spooked by something as he will then pull away from whatever it is that he is unsure of.

Due to nervous nature, we feel that a home with children would be too much for him. He can be rehomed with sensible teenagers 16+ who will respect his space. We really hope that he finds his forever home soon as he really does have so much potential.

Barkby's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers

Barkby is a handsome big lad who came in to us after being found as a stray, sadly nobody came forward to claim him or give us any information on him, so he is now looking for his new forever home.

He is a big playful boy with lots and lots of love to give, he doesn’t quite realise his size at times and tries to greet everyone he meets with lots of enthusiasm! He would definitely benefit from a home with people who had an interest in training and the patience to help teach him some manners and boundaries. This has been started with him here at the rescue and he is doing so well! Although he means no harm anyone interested in him will need to be confident with big dogs.

Barkby absolutely loves playing with toys and running around the secure paddocks here at the rescue and he enjoys being out and about exploring new places too. He can be quite strong on lead but we are working on this and he is already showing improvements when calm, this will need to be continued when he goes to his new home in order to have full control of him when out walking.

We have introduced him to a variety of dogs since being with us and he seems to really like their company! He loves to play but as we expected, he can be too full on for some dogs. We will continue to assess him and mix him further but we do think he may have the potential to live with a compatible dog as long as the introductions go well here at the rescue, but would equally be fine as the only pet too. We feel that he is best suited to a home with sensible older teenagers due to his size and how excitable he can be at times.

Barkby is very eager to please, is quick to learn and is highly trainable – he is very food motivated and focuses on his handler well. He really does have so much potential, he just needs someone with time to put into him!

We really hope that he finds his forever home soon as he will make such an amazing companion 🙂

Skar's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with dogs
is toilet trained

Skar is a friendly girl, who arrived as a stray very scared and frightened. We have been spending extra time with her and she now shows her playful, cheeky and loving side!

Since she arrived as a stray we have no history on her. She was very shut down the first few days but slowly started coming out of her shell with the staff. She is more comfortable with women and can be quite timid of men, but this is something we are working on. Once she knows you she can get very jumpy and mouthy, due to this she is looking for a adult only home. She does get quite attached to staff here so we think she will have some separation anxiety so she’ll be suited to a home where she wont be left for long periods.

She is very playful and loves a game of ball and chase! She is very smart and already knows some tricks including, ‘sit, wait, fetch, paw, bark, middle’ etc so someone has put in work with her training. She will be best suited to an active home where someone can stimulate her both physcially and mental as she is very smart and eager to learn.

She has met a few dogs while here with us, she is happy to walk with them but mostly ignores them, she’s more interested in her human friends and toys! She does have the potential to live with another dog pending dog mixes here at the rescue, but we are still learning about her. Initally she was quite timid with veterinary treatment but this is improving and we can discuss more with potential adopters.

She does find kennels very stressful and easily gets very overwhelmed here so we hope she finds a home soon as she is lovely girl who isn’t getting enough exercise and stimulation here at the rescue.

Jaffa was understandably quite bewildered and unsettled when she first arrived but she has settled into the routine here at the rescue now and has started to go out for walks with some of our volunteers. She can be timid at times especially at sudden noises but her confidence is starting to grow, she will benefit from going to live with owners that will put time and effort into her ongoing training and socialisation. She can be strong on the lead at times although generally does walk nicely, anyone interested must be physically capable of handling a big dog.

We have started testing Jaffa around other dogs and so far she seems generally uninterested and unsure of them, we will keep assessing her during her stay with us. She may have potential to live with a compatible similar sized male dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue, but will also thrive in a home as the only pet.
Jaffa is a cheeky, playful girl when playing in our secure paddock and does like to zoom around.
We hope a suitable home comes along soon, she will definitely appeal to large breed/mastiff lovers 🙂

I'm Titan and I'm looking for a home with people who will spend lots of time with me :)

Age: 1 year 3 months

Sex: Male

Breed: Labrador x French Bulldog

Titan's Notes:

Titan is a young, energetic boy who came to us due to his owners change of circumstances. He did find a home but was returned due to them struggling to manage his behaviour. He is a typical teenage dog currently and does try does push boundaries, he needs owners that will be firm but fair with him and input a steady routine and boundaries to help him settle within the home – we will advise on all of this.

Titan is a sweet, friendly boy who is still young and full of energy. He will be a great adventure buddy where he can go on long walks and have lots of socialisation. He will suit a home where he won’t be left on his own for long periods, and where he can get lots of mental stimulation as well as physical exercise in order to satisfy him.

He enjoys his toys and playing, travels well in the car and very friendly when meeting people out and about. He can be quite strong on lead initially so will benefit from training in this area. In the home he can be possessive over toys so new owners should be aware of this – again, this is something we will advise on and work with him on during his stay with us. He can also be quite mouthy/grabby when over-excited and over-stimulated.

Titan is fine passing dogs on walks, but he has never lived with another dog in the home so he is looking to be the only dog as this is what he is used to. He is also looking for an adult only home.

We hope Titan finds a home soon as he does find kennels quite stressful and he would love a garden to run around and play in. He is still a young boy who needs owners who will be dedicated to putting time and effort into his ongoing training and socialisation.

Sex: Female

Breed: SBT Cross Malinois

Angel's Notes:

Angel is a sweet girl who was understandably very nervous when she first came to us after being handed in as a stray, unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim her so she is now looking for her forever home.

We did manage to get some more info about her from a member of the public which has given us an insight into her background, unfortunately, her past is a sad one. She did recently find a home but was sadly returned a couple of days later due to the owner struggling to manage her when she got overexcited and started heavily mouthing. This beautiful girl requires plenty of patience and understanding after all she has been through.

She is an extremely loving girl once she gets to know you and loves to give you lots of cuddles! Due to mistreatment when she was younger she can be unsure of new people initially, especially of men but but can be won around quite easily once she knows that you are not going to hurt her. She has sadly had quite a hard life up to now with no stability, and would really benefit from a home with people who will be dedicated to her and her socialisation.

Angel absolutely loves running around playing with toys, especially tennis balls! She is an energetic girl and will require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation in order to meet her needs. She would be the perfect running partner/adventure buddy for someone!

We have been introducing her to other dogs and she seems to get on with them really well out and about, she can potentially live with another dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue. Due to her being a timid girl, she is looking for a home with sensible older teenagers.

We really hope that the right home comes along for her soon as she is struggling with kennel life.

Are you as active as me, and if so, maybe we could go on adventures together??

Age: 6 years 10 months

Sex: Male

Breed: Springer Spaniel

Bentley's Notes:

friendly with dogs
has lived with dogs
can't live with children

Bentley is a handsome boy who was originally signed over to us due to his owner not having time for him, we did find him a new home but he was returned to us due to an incident with one of his owners – this was out of character for him and we will explain more to anyone interested in rehoming him. We have had no issues with him since he has been back at the kennels.

Bentley is very much so your typical spaniel, he is high energy and is into everything. Unfortunately in his original home his owners struggled to give him the time that he needs so he hadn’t been walked much. He does have the tendency to shadow chase and will fixate on reflections, but he can be distracted quite easily from them and we are hoping that when he is in a good routine and getting the exercise and mental stimulation that he needs, this will subside.

He will benefit from owners that are used to having active breeds and understand the need to satisfy them mentally as well as physically – he would walk all day if he could! He is strong on the lead so will benefit from further lead training in this area, and will also require some recall training as he can be reluctant to come back when off lead, it is just too much fun exploring!

Bentley has lived with another dog in his original home so does have potential to live with a compatible dog as long as introductions go well here at the rescue. On walks he tends to ignore other dogs, sniffing and exploring his environment is his main focus on walks. He is looking for a calm adult only home with no visiting children either. He will thrive in a home with owners who will input a routine and boundaries from the start.

Anyone interested in rehoming Bentley must be willing to come up to the rescue to visit him a couple of times before taking him home. We hope a suitable home comes along soon for him as he is struggling with kennel life.

Lulu is a very sweet, friendly girl who came to us due to no fault of her own. She is now looking for an active where she can go on loads of adventures!

Lulu is friendly girl with people she meets. She is an active dog so will suit a home where she can get lots of exercise and play time. She is still learning to play with toys here at the rescue, she more enjoys playing chase in the paddock! She is a very fun and energetic girl, she will be a great hiking companion.

She can be quite strong on lead so she will benefit from some lead training but she is still young and eager to learn. She is quite curious about dogs and will walk past dogs at the rescue without reacting. She has made some friends but she is very unsure when initating play but she has lots of potential. Her new owners will need to work on her socialsation to show her dogs aren’t as scary as she thinks! While we are still assessing her, she will be looking for a home as the only pet as this is what she’s used to.

She is a lovely, excitable girl that would make a great companion for someone!

Jim's Notes:

friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers
good on the lead
isn't toilet trained

Jim came to us originally as a transfer from another rescue. We did rehome him, however he was returned due to the owners not managing with his behaviour.

Jim is a very sweet boy, who started with us very timid and nervous. After settling with us, he became a very affectionate and friendly boy with people and dogs. In the home, he was quite excitable and overly playful, but without management it was leading to some puppy behaviour and mouthing. His next home will need to be focused on training him and putting boundaries in place to prevent this behaviour displaying. This is something that can be managed and our team will help advise anyone interested in him. Due to his behaviour, he is looking for an adult only home.

He was showing signs of seperation anxiety in the home too, but again, boundries will need to be in place to start training Jim from the beginning. However, he will be suited to a home where he won’t be left alone to long. Jim is a lovely boy who will make an amazing companion for someone as he really enjoys walks and being out and about. Jim does have the potential to live with another dog pending dog mixes here at the rescue.

Jim likes his toys and enjoys playing tug of war with you! He clearly hasn’t seen much of the world so needs a bit of training and someone to show him the world isn’t that scary! He will make a great companion to someone and we home he finds his forever home soon.

Sex: Male

Breed: Czech German Shepherd

Otis's Notes:

Otis is a stunning boy who originally came into us as a stray in August 2024. Nobody came forward for him so he is now looking for his new forever home, due to Otis coming into us as a stray we sadly don’t have any of his background history which would be helpful with a dog like him. During his stay with us so far he did go out on foster for a couple of months to get him out of the kennel environment and this allowed us to learn even more about him and figure out what kind of home he would do best in. We have a in-depth document of notes from his fosterer which gives us lots of detail of his behaviour within the home and out and about which we will share with anyone that is interested in rehoming him.

Otis is a friendly boy but can be aloof until he gets to know you.. then he is more than happy to show you his personality and he does form strong bonds! He likes to be busy and in the kennel environment his main focus is getting out exploring as quick as he can! He is energetic and is looking for a home with people who will really spend the time trying to tire his brain out just as much his body. He loves playing lots of different mind games and would carry a toy absolutely everywhere he goes if he could!

Due to this and his size and strength, he is looking for a home with older teenagers 16+ who are used to being around big boisterous dogs and will get involved in his training.. even better if they will also play with toys with him!

He really enjoys being out and about exploring, he goes out with quite a few of our volunteers and he has developed a lovely bond with them because of it. He is very strong on lead at times but does settle down once he gets going, anyone interested in him must be physically capable of handling him. He is both food and toy motivated which definitely helps with his training, he is very eager to please and loves to learn. Once he is out of this environment and getting all of his needs satisfied we know that he will calm down and improve massively.

Otis is generally uninterested in other dogs and has clearly lacked socialisation – his fosterer found that he would mimic other dogs, if they were calm with him he’d be calm, if they barked he’d bark back etc. He is looking for a home as the only pet where he can have all of the attention to himself but would benefit from continued socialisation in his next home. He would be ideal for people with Shepherd experience but this isn’t essential as long as research has been done and potential owners are dedicated to him and his ongoing training.

We really hope that Otis finds his forever home soon as he needs far more than we can give him within the kennel environment.

I’m Jessie and I am a sweet but unsure girl who needs someone to work with me.

Age: 7 years old

Sex: Female

Breed: Labrador x Lurcher

Jessie's Notes:

can live with older children
friendly with strangers
is toilet trained
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs
can't live with young children

Jessie is a sweet girl who was returned to the rescue as her owners were unable to cope with her behaviour. She has sadly been in and out of our care for a few years now so we’d really love to find her the perfect match soon.

In the home she is described as being perfect, she is fully housetrained, friendly with visitors and loved sunbathing and playing ball in the garden. She is a very cheeky, lovely girl who loves a cuddle and a good run round playing hide and seek! She does love her toys as well, and chasing tennis balls. She will find any bit of sunshine to sunbathe in and likes being wrapped up in her blankets at night.

She can be quite reactive to other dogs on walks and with dogs passing outside. She is gen-con trained so she is easier to manage once you know her traits and with good lead control, she walks beautifully. When she first came to us, she joined off-lead mixes with multiple dogs and was very playful, however an incident in a home caused her to become very nervous and fearful of dogs. It is larger breeds that Jessie is reactive to, so she needs quitter walks where she can have calmer walks to do plenty of sniffing. We will give full advice and support with this as she settles into her new home.

So far, she’s had an unsteady few years in kennels so we really hope her next home is her final one. She is a gorgeous girl who will flourish in the right environment. Anyone interested in Jessie will need to come to the rescue a couple times to spend time with her. She is a firm favourite with staff and we love her cheeky side, we hope someone comes to see her soon as she really deserves a forever home.

Recently Jessie has had a short-term trial in a home, where was very well behaved and was very good passing dogs on walks. With correct handling she is very responsive to training and learning new commands. She travels very well in the car, settles at night and during work hours. She enjoyed napping in the garden and burrowing in blankets on the sofa. Jessie is very nervous and reactive to veterinary treatment, especially areas around her neck, ie, holding her collar and spot-on treatments. We can explain this in further detail with anyone interested.

Age: 5 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Labrador x Staffie

Tyson's Notes:

friendly with strangers
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs

Tyson is a sweet and energetic boy who found himself in our care as his previous owners were unable to devote the time he deserves. He has been with us for a couple of years now, and we really can’t understand why! We really hope he gets a chance of having a forever home soon.

Despite not receiving any training or being walked on a lead until he came into us, Tyson is eager to learn and has already shown improvement during his time with us. Tyson is a friendly boy with people and will meet his best friends with a big jump and a kiss! He will be a great adventure companion as he is always eager to go for walks and explore new places! However, it’s clear Tyson hasn’t seen much of the outside world as he can be overwhelmed sometimes. However, with a confident handler, he will thrive in a home. Tyson is looking for a home with adults only.

Tyson isn’t a fan of other dogs and will bark at some especially if they bark at him first, other times he is happy to ignore them and carry on sniffing – he loves quiet walks away from busy areas as he can relax fully then. He can be strong on lead at times so new owners must be able to handle his strength. Tyson is a big lover of toys so would love a garden of his own to play in but requires high fences.

Overall, Tyson is a wonderful dog with a lot of potential, and we are confident that with a patient, loving, and experienced owner, he will thrive and make a great addition to any family.

Bronwen is a pretty girl who originally came into our care as a stray, she was rehomed for a short period but came back to us due to her new owners not feeling confident with her behaviour and strength. She is now looking for a new home with people who are willing to put a lot of time and effort into her training and ongoing socialisation, she will suit owners who are used to strong bull-breeds.

Although it is a shame that her first home didn’t work out, we now know more about her and how she behaves in the home – she is fine to be left for a couple of hours at a time, she is mostly house trained, travels well in the car and loves to play with toys.
She is strong on lead and doesn’t have good recall – we are working on this with her but she will need continued training in these areas and any new owners must be physically capable of handling her strength until her lead-walking improves.
When she first arrived at the rescue she was friendly with dogs and loved to meet them and play, however during her stay with us this has declined due to kennel stress – we will continue to work on her socialisation with dogs during her stay with us but she will be looking for a home as the only pet and new owners should be willing to work on this with her gradually – we can advise on this. She is looking for a home without children living in the home or visiting, but can be rehomed with teenagers 16+.

Bronwen will thrive in a home that is in a quieter area for walks and will benefit from a decent sized secure garden so that she has space to play as she is a very cheeky, playful girl. We really hope a suitable home comes along soon for her, she is still only young and has lots to learn.

She came into our care with ear issues and is currently under the care of our vets for them and this is likely to be an ongoing issue sadly. She can be seen at our on-site vets for her ears due it being a pre-existing issue.

Harley's Notes:

Harley is a sweet girl who came into our care due to her owners circumstances changing, she is understandably quite bewildered here at the rescue but is settling in gradually and we know she will thrive once she is back in a home environment. She is looking for a home with people who will be patient with her whilst she adjusts to her new home as she had been with her previous owner since she was a puppy.

She is looking for a home with teenagers 14+ as she hasn’t been around young children before and will suit a quieter home. She is quite an easy going girl who is generally quite chilled but can be excitable and playful too.

Harley has met a few dogs since her arrival and has been friendly with them, she has also shared a home with another Frenchie previously so does have potential to live with a compatible dog as long as introductions went well here at the rescue however she will also thrive in a home as the only pet.

Harley does require a specific diet (Hypoallergenic food) which we will explain to anyone interested in rehoming her. She doesn’t like the vets/vet treatment due to a traumatic experience previously which will need continued work and management which we can advise on. She really is a little sweetie and we hope a suitable home comes along soon for her so she can get back to enjoying her home comforts.

Duke + Daisy's Notes:

Duke + Daisy are a lovely pair of siblings who were rehomed from us in 2018, they have been well loved but are now sadly looking for a new home due to their owners health declining. They are almost 11 years old now so we really hope they find a new home soon.

They are looking for a new home where they can stay together as they have never been apart, Duke is also blind and does seem to rely on his sister for confidence at times. They are easy going dogs who are no trouble to care for, they enjoy their walks but are generally low energy and are happy with shorter walks as long as they have a garden they can potter in too. Duke manages well and is quite a confident lad despite his lack of eyesight, but new owners will need to take extra care with him on walks etc and it may take him a few days to adjust to his new home and garden.

They are looking for a home where it is just the pair of them as the only pets, they have been used to a visiting dog coming round and also visiting children. They travel well in the car (crate in the boot) and behave well with visitors coming into the home.

Duke and Daisy are currently in a foster home but still looking for a forever home. They are both lovely dogs who would make amazing companions.

Solo is a sweet boy who came into us due to no fault of his own, he is now looking for his new forever home where he will be spoilt and loved.

He is a playful lad who enjoys being out and about on his walks, he can be quite strong when he wants to be but will settle down once he gets going. He is looking for an active home with people who will take him on lots of enjoyable adventures! He can be rehomed with sensible children 14+ who are confident with dogs.

Solo has a very sweet temperament, he was understandably very timid and unsure when he first arrived but has been coming out of his shell more and more every day. He can be timid of men due to past bad experiences so can take a bit of time to trust, but food seems to be the way to his heart!

We have introduced Solo to other dogs and he seems to really enjoy their company, he likes to play but can be a little full on at times. We will continue testing him in this area but we do think that he has the potential to live with a compatible dog as long as the introductions went well here at the rescue.

Midnight is a stunning girl who came into our care as a stray, no one has come forward to claim her so she is now looking for a new home.

Due to her being a stray we have no background information on her, so new owners must be willing to put in some training if needed. She is a lovely girl who was quite timid on arrival but it didn’t take long for her to come out of her shell.

She has been friendly with everyone that she has met so far, she is a typical young bouncy Lurcher who will require daily exercise and mental stimulation to keep her satisfied. She is a fit and active dog who will make a great adventure buddy.

We are still assessing Midnight as she is quite new in, but so far we feel that she can be rehomed with sensible children 10+ as long as they are dog-savvy as she can be boisterous. Midnight seems to require further socialisation with other dogs and this is something we are still testing with her, for now we feel that she will suit a home as the only pet but this may change during her stay with us. Due to her breed she is looking for a home without cats and small furries as she does have a prey drive.

Age: 3 years old approx

Sex: Male

Breed: Cane Corso

Waffle's Notes:

can't live with children
can't live with young children

Waffle is a big striking lad who was handed in as a stray in bad condition, we have no background history on him sadly but have started his assessments now that he is more settled at the rescue, we will be continuing to assess him further during his stay with us but we feel that he is ready to start the search for a suitable new home.

When Waffle first arrived he was petrified and defensive but we have been working with him and are now seeing his cheeky, playful side coming out more. He was quite underweight when he arrived but he has been gaining weight at a steady rate and we are hopeful that he will soon be back to prime condition. He can be hand-shy and flinches if you move too quickly around him but we are seeing improvements now that he is building bonds with staff members.

Waffle loves running around in our secure off lead area and is very playful! He is gradually gaining confidence in other areas on site too but the paddock is definitely his favourite.

We are looking for an experienced home for Waffle – with owners that have Cane Corso (or other similar breed) experience as he can be typical of his guardian breed and is quite strong-willed. He will require owners that will be firm but fair with him and they will need to input a steady routine and boundaries with him to help him settle and thrive. Due to us having no background history on him he will need owners that are willing to train and work with him so that he can reach his full potential. Waffle is a large, strong dog so any new owners will need to be physically able to manage his size and strength.

We are still assessing Waffle around other dogs but so far he seems nervous around them, we will continue to test him during his stay with us but at the moment he is looking for a home where he is the only pet in the home.

Anyone interested in Waffle must be willing to dedicate time to coming up to the rescue to build a bond and get to know him well before he went to his new home. We really hope a suitable home comes along soon for him 🙂

Wooof! I'm Alfie and I'm an older boy looking for a nice calm home please.

Age: 13 years, 10 months

Sex: Male

Breed: Terrier x

Alfie's Notes:

friendly with strangers
good on the lead
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs

Alfie was a previous resident in 2013 and was adopted, but has been returned due to his owner sadly passing away. He’s now looking for a home where he can have loads of attention and rest in his old age.

Alfie is a 13 year old terrier cross. He is a sweet boy that enjoys a cuddle but he is also still quite active so will need a home that can provide him with daily walks. We were told that he can be quite reactive out and about to other dogs, at the rescue so far Alfie will pass dogs fine on walks. We will continue to test him with his socalisation while he is with us, but he is looking for a home as the only dog in the home and will need owners that can manage him around dogs if needed. He is used to being around older children, however we think he might prefer a quiet adult only home this time around.

We think he may be mostly deaf, but this could be selective hearing! He also isn’t fully housetrained as he does have the occassional accident in the home. However, he is a very sweet boy who we hope isn’t in kennels long due to him being an older boy.

Phillip,https://ncar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Phillip-1-2022.png,https://ncar.org.uk/animals/phillip-2/,Age: 6 years old,Sex: Male,Breed: Huntaway/Collie/Rottie mix,,CH8 9BD,North Clwyd Animal Rescue,"Wooof! I'm Phillip, I'm a lovely lad with a big personality. I need a home with people who will work with me, follow guidance from my friends here at the rescue and take me on lots of adventures!

Age: 6 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Huntaway/Collie/Rottie mix

Phillip's Notes:

can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs
can't live with children
can't live with young children

Phillip is a handsome lad who came into our care as a stray in June 2021, so he has been with us for a long time now bless him. He has been rehomed once but was returned after a week due to his behaviour/showing aggression towards visitors in the home.

Since Phillip has been with us for so long we know him really well now and do feel that he will make an amazing companion in the right quiet home, he will suit a home with minimal visitors and owners who will be sensible and seperate Phillip if needed when people do come over. He tends to bond to people quite quickly and is generally a friendly lad but he can occasionally take a dislike to some people so any new owners must be confident on managing his strength and reading his behaviour. He is a loyal boy who is a great companion on walks and loves his trusted people. Due to his history he needs a home without children and cannot be around visiting children either.

Although the above paragraph may come across quite negative – we do have to be honest as we really would love to find him the right forever home, he is currently in his prime years and it is so sad that he has been waiting for so long. He will be the perfect adventure buddy as he loves long walks, playing in water and generally exploring. Here at the rescue he loves running around the paddock and splashing in the paddling pools. Once he gets to know you, he’ll be your loyal companion and will shower you with love and attention. He is looking for a home as the only pet, he is usually good with most dogs he meets but does take the occasional disliking to some. He does have good play skills and with further socialisation we know he will continue to improve.

Although he has been here for a few years now, please don’t let that discourage you, Phil really is an amazing boy who’s a favorite among our staff and volunteers.

If you’re interested in adopting Phil, we encourage you to fill in an application form and we can have a chat and invite you for an appointment – please note that he will require multiple visits to get to know him and receive guidance from our behaviour team. Phil has a lot of potential and we’re confident that he’ll make a great addition to the right home. Come meet him and let’s find him his forever family!

Age: 2 Years Old

Sex: Female

Breed: Hound

Holly's Notes:

can live with sensible children
can live with other dogs
friendly with dogs
friendly with strangers
isn't toilet trained

Holly is such a beautiful girl who came into us as a stray, she is now looking for her new forever home which we can’t wait for her to find as she is wasted in kennels!

Holly is a lovely girl who has lots of love to give! She is affectionate and cuddly and is quite people orientated which is good. She can be timid at times but does tend to look to her handler for guidance. Due to her coming into us as a stray, we don’t have any background history on her and aren’t sure if she has ever lived in a home environment, we feel that she would thrive as being part of a family though.

She really enjoys being out and about on adventures or running around our secure off lead areas here at the rescue! She can be a bit strong when she wants to be but walks really well on a gen-con. Her recall is quite hit and miss, typical of her breed! But she is very food motivated which definitely helps with training.

Since she has been with us she has met a large variety of different dogs and has been fantastic with them, she walks well with them and has also showed great social skills when off lead with them too. She has the potential to live with a compatible dog as long as the introductions go well here at the rescue. Being a hound Holly would not be suitable to live with cats or other small furries. Holly can be rehomed with children 12+ who are sensible and dog-savvy.

Overall she is an amazing girl who is a firm favourite here at NCAR and we hope a suitable home comes along for her soon.

Age: 11 years old

Sex: Male

Breed: Staffie cross

Mack's Notes:

Mack is a super sweet boy who has sadly been with us since November 2022, he did find a home recently but was sadly returned after a few days due to them struggling to manage him in the home.

Before Mack came into us, he sadly had never been inside a home before and lived in the garden, and has been in kennels with us ever since so everything outside of this is very new to him and he will understandably take some time to adjust to new environments and living in a home. He needs owners who will be patient with him and follow guidance given from our team who know Mack really well. Mack is looking for a quiet home with people who are dog-savvy and confident, despite his quirks Mack has some amazing qualities too and is a favourite here.

Mack loves his walks and is still energetic for his age so will require daily exercise.
He isn’t well socialised with other dogs and can be reactive at times, for the majority of the time he can pass them fine on walks but does not like them coming up to him.
He is looking for a stable home without children or many visitors so that he can feel settled, safe and secure. We hope he is lucky and finds a new home soon as kennels are no place for a dog of his age to be.

I’m Reece and I am very stressed in kennels and need a home committed to training me properly. I promise that I will return you with the best cuddles you could ever imagine!

Age: 4 Years 8 Months

Sex: Male

Breed: Staffy cross

Reece's Notes:

friendly with dogs
can’t live with cats
can't live with dogs
can't live with children

Reece is a stunning boy who came into us after being transferred to us from a pound, they had ran out of space and he was due to be euthanised, so we stepped in to save him and he has been with us since. We would love nothing more than to see him find his forever home!

He is a really sweet lad who does struggle with kennel life at times. He is really friendly with those that he trusts and definitely seems to think he is a lapdog! He really enjoys being out and about on long walks, or playing fetch in our secure paddock area – he would do this all day if he could!

Reece can be quite anxious in new situations and around some new people – men in particular. Unfortunately, due to him coming from the pound we have no record of his previous history. Due to this he is looking or a quiet adult only home.

Reece mixes with other dogs on a daily basis and does enjoy their company on walks. He isn’t keen on sharing his toys though! We think he would be better as the only pet but would benefit from continued socialisation out on walks.

He is a sensitive boy and does struggle with sudden loud noises, he just wants to hide or cuddle up to you, but is anxious about walking when there is gunshots going off close to the rescue. We have a good routine with him when this happens and he does seek comfort from those that he trusts.

Reece would thrive in a calm home that can help him learn to stay calm in stressful situations. He is very clever and eager to learn and he adores playing with toys. He needs some training in a few areas, but with the help of an experienced and loving home who the NCAR behaviour team will work alongside, we are sure that he can reach his full potential.

We hope that there is a loving family out there who can give Reece the second chance he deserves and help him become the best dog he can be!

My name is Atari and I am a beautiful girl ready to find my forever home :)

Age: 1 - 2 years old

Sex: Female

Breed: Cane corso Cross

Atari's Notes:

can live with older children
can't live with dogs

Atari is a beautiful girl who originally came into our care as a stray, she was rehomed for a short period but was returned as unfortunately she didn’t get on with the other dog in the home.

She is a lovely and affectionate girl with people she is familiar with, she can be a little unsure of some men but is easily won around with treats and is much better when she is able to approach in her own time.. we have been working on this with her during her stay and she has built bonds with many male volunteers since her arrival. She has clearly lacked socialisation before coming into our care but due to her only being young still, with the right people by her side we know she will blossom.

Atari generally interacts well with other dogs when she is out walking and tends to ignore them, but we now know that she isn’t keen on sharing her space/home with other animals. Due to this, she is looking for a home where she will be the only pet and get all of the attention to herself! She will benefit from further socialisation with dogs. Atari can be rehomed with sensible teenagers 16+ due to her occasional nervousness, size and bouncy behaviour at times.

She really loves being out and about exploring, she generally walks well on lead once her excitement has worn off! She loves playing with toys and pottering around in the garden. She is looking for a home where she won’t be left for long hours as she loves having company, in the home she was being left for 4 hours max and settled well – just hide the recycling from her!

We really hope that she finds her forever home soon as she has so much potential to be an amazing companion for someone.

My name is Dolly and I am a sweet girl and I really love my friends here at the rescue, but I can't wait to find my forever home.

Age: 3 Years Old

Sex: Female

Breed: Pocket Bully

Dolly's Notes:

can't live with dogs
can't live with children

Dolly is an anxious girl who came to the rescue as a stray. She was rehomed but was sadly returned to us due to her owner struggling to manage her nervous behaviour when out on walks.

When Dolly originally came into us she was absolutely terrified on arrival and took some persuading to become friends. She is very food motivated so we have been working on her issues with strangers by everyone she meets giving her lots of treats. This will continue to be a work in progress when she goes to a new home.

She does lack confidence when out walking and is easily spooked by a variety of different things, and she can take some persuasion to get her walking. Off lead in our paddock, she is super playful and loves burning off some steam! Dolly does get very anxious of other dogs, and although we have started to work on this with her, we would be looking for a home as the only pet in a home and this work will need to be continued. All advice and help will be given by our behaviour team here at NCAR.

Due to her nervous nature, Dolly is looking for a home without children living in the home or visiting. She needs a home with owners who are calm and confident and can build Dolly’s self esteem. Underneath her fear – she is a sweet girl who deserves a second chance!

Age: 9 years old

Sex: Female

Breed: Collie cross Rottweiler

Sadie's Notes:

Sadie is a lovely girl who has been returned to the rescue after her owner sadly passed away and the family member who was looking after Sadie didn’t feel that they could give her everything she needs, so she is now on the hunt for a new home.

Sadie is a very clever girl who knows various commands and loves to learn. She can be nervous of some new people (men in particular) and doesn’t like bikes so needs further training and socialisation in these areas. She is well behaved in the home and has good manners which include not getting on the sofa unless invited, she is completely house-trained and travels well in the car. She likes being out and about exploring and is used to daily walks.

Sadie is looking for a home as the only pet as this is what she has been used to. She is looking for owners that are willing to put time and effort into her training and socialisation as she does have a few things that need working on, this work has started here at NCAR but will need continuing when she goes to her new home. Full behaviour advice and support will be given to anyone that is interested in Sadie.

Overall she is a really loving girl and we hope a suitable home comes along soon for her.

 Maize – D2025-71
4-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

Say hello to Maize, a sweet and cheerful little lady who adores everyone she meets! 

Maize greets you with a wagging tail and a big smile, always ready for cuddles and ear scratches. She’s a people-loving girl who just wants to be part of the fun, though she does like to be close—sometimes a little too close, so her new family will need to be mindful of her getting underfoot.

 Maize is happiest with company and will need a resident dog in her forever home to guide her and keep her confidence growing. She’s still learning about play—she’s recently started carrying teddies around, which is adorable—but she’ll need time and patience to discover the joy of toys and walks.

 More about Maize:

Must go on a neutering agreement
Can live with dog-savvy children (8+)
Not cat or small furry tested
Has only had her 1st vaccination, so not yet walked outside
May bark at dogs on the TV (but runs away after!)
Travels well in the car—perfect holiday buddy 
Housetrained
Eats well with other dogs, though she’s happy to hoover up leftovers
Sleeps overnight on her bed/blanket in the kitchen, and naps happily during the day
Takes treats very gently

Maize is fostered in Cardiff and is now ready to find her forever family who can offer patience, cuddles, and a doggy companion to help her shine

 Adorable Collie Cross Puppies Looking for Their Forever Homes 

We have 7 beautiful Collie cross puppies – 4 girls and 3 boys – who will be ready to go to their new homes from mid-September.

These pups have been hand-reared, which means they’ve missed out on some of the lessons mum would normally teach – like bite inhibition and boundaries. Right now, they’re typical land sharks  (hands and feet beware!), so they’ll need families committed to consistent training and positive guidance.

 What They Need:

Patient, dog-savvy homes prepared to teach them the ropes
Puppy socialisation and training classes (required as part of the adoption contract)
Families with sensible children or adults only
Opportunities for adventure, enrichment, and structure
A willingness to continue their training journey into adolescence and beyond

They’re young enough to learn about living with cats, and can either be only dogs or join homes with other friendly dogs.

 They Will Come:

With 1st vaccinations
Microchipped
Up-to-date with flea and worm treatments
With a neutering agreement as part of the adoption
And 5 weeks free Agria Pet Insurance

These are not just puppies – they’re our next rescue ambassadors, ready to grow into loyal, loving companions.

 Currently being fostered in Crewe, Cheshire.

 If you’re ready for the joys and challenges of raising a rescue pup and think you can offer one of these special souls a home, please get in touch. We’ll be looking for the best matches, not the fastest responses.

Benji D2025 – 65

Can be an only dog with doggy friends
Can live with other dogs
No cats
Older dog savvy children

Benji is a 17 month old mixed breed described by his foster mum as a confident, cheeky and loveable little man who is happy to say hello to everyone he meets.

He has not been on walks yet as awaiting his second vaccination.

Benji has tremours due to having distemper as a puppy. He has been assessed by the vets and no medication is needed. He has had blood tests since arriving from Turkey and these are fine. He is currently under weight and is being fed lots of small meals to help with this.

He has currently not met any children but loves to play so would be fine with older dog savvy children.

Benji loves toys and playing with the other dogs in his foster home. He enjoys cuddling with dogs and humans alike.

He likes to remind his foster mum that he is hungry and needs feeding and often complains of the slow service in his foster home.

Not cat or small furry tested.

Benji loves playing with toys and exploring the toy box. He is happy to play with them on his own or with the other dogs in his foster home. He loves a game of tug of war and find a squeaky toy quite tuneful. He adores tearing around the garden playing chase with the others. Benji loves to play at being caught and rolling around on the floor to have his tummy tickled. He is very playful and active.

He is a bit nervous in new places and wary on a lead. He is happy to have his harness and lead on and is good in the car. He needs to learn about lead walking in his new home. 

Benji loves to sleep on a cosy bed or sofa and sleeps downstairs with the other dogs.

Benji is fully house trained as long as he has access to the garden.

As Benji is having a lot of small meals he will growl a warning if another dog gets a bit too close. In his foster home he trusts that another dog will not steal his food and that foster mum will make sure he can eat in peace. This will need to continue in his forever home. Despite having a ruff start in life he does have a sensitive stomach and needs a sensitive food.

Benji would like a home with another playful dog. A home with lots of toys and a garden to practice his zoomies. He would benefit from attending dog training classes to learn basic commands and be a well rounded rescue ambassador. He could also be an only dog with lots of doggie friends and owners home most of the time to play with him.

Banjo D2022-76

Can be an only dog eith doggy friends
Could also live with another dog
No cats
Older dog savvy children

Banjo is a 5 Year old Labrador cross described by his foster mum as a lovely happy and affectionate boy. He loves people and gets on fine with other dogs. He adores going for walks and meeting people. He can be a bit wary if meeting men or small dogs but once reassured he is fine. Despite only having 3 legs he is a strong boy and loves running in the fields on a long line. He loves a comfy bed, cuddles and his soft toys.

Not tested with children. He is a strong boy and sometimes jumps up to greet you, so possibly older children or dog savvy children who can tell him ‘off’ as he does listen.

He thinks cats are for chasing so cannot be homed with cats.

Banjo loves to chase the resident dogs around the garden. He loves his soft cuddly toys that he likes to cuddle when he is sleeping but has not shown much interest in playing with the toys yet.

Banjo adores his walks, sniffing and stopping to rest now and again. He loves long runs in the fields on a long line and would love to have a run in a secure field. He has a harness, lead and is great using a slip lead. He also listens to commands. He also has wheels made for him, but he has not used them in his foster home. Banjo is a total joy to walk, he is strong but such fun.

Banjo sleeps downstairs with the other dogs and has a selection of dog beds, memory foam beds, sofas and cuddly toys. He sleeps all night and is good during the day, he is an absolute dream!

He is house trained and has access to the garden all day.

Banjo has his own raised slow feeder dog bowl. He has a sensitive tummy so is fed specific food for his needs. He is happy to eat from just his bowl and leave other dogs alone whilst they are eating. He knows the others will not take his food but he is happy for them to lick his bowl once he has had enough and walked away from it. He loves his treats and is learning to join the queue at treat time.

Banjo would love an active home with a big garden and possibly doggy friends. He would love to go for lots of walks in fields, on the beach just be a proper adventure buddy. This boy embraces every opportunity life offers him. He would love to have days filled with fun and action and evenings having cuddles on the sofa. He has happily been an only dog but is also happily living with other dogs.

Jessie can be reactive with other dogs off lead which is easily manageable, she will generally ignore them out walking on lead.  There are plenty of secure dog fields around now and if you are lucky enough to live in or near a rural area then other dogs can easily be avoided. Jessie doesn’t need masses of long walks and will periodically say that actually she would rather have a cuddle on the sofa today! Jessie will chase cats so a home without them is best.  Jessie is house trained, travels ok, loves playing fetch, use to being left 1/2 hours and walks nicely on a loose lead. If you may be interested in helping Jessie have a loving, comfortable retirement and want to discuss her further then please apply online.",09/15/2025

Shadow was a welfare case and had been living in a car, he has had very limited socialisation with many people and dogs.  The big wide world can be a little overstimulating for him, understandably, so introductions to new people and experiences will need to be taken very slowly.  We love this boy, he is so funny and quite the goof but you do need to earn his trust. His ideal new owner will have tons of patience and be prepared to take life at a pace that Shadow can handle, ideally in a more rural area, in return you will end up with a loyal, funny companion to keep you entertained!   He loves to play with toys, enjoys having zoomies and has begun to enjoy and ask for affection.  Shadow is house trained, playful with other small/big dogs off lead, use to being left 2/3 hours and walks to a loose lead. Shadow does whine while travelling but will settle after a short time, due to his high prey drive – he is a sighthound after all –  its best not to rehome him with cats or small furries and he would be better suited as the only dog in the home.

Molly is comfortable being left 2/3 hours. Molly does not like other dogs if they approach her space on lead and she cannot be let off lead unless she is in a secure space due to her dog reactivity so she will need to be muzzled in public places, we all know that at some point an off lead dog could get in your path.

Meet Miso, a cheery little chap on the look out for his new home.

Miso is a real little character who generally has an outgoing and adventurers’ approach to life.

He does have some complex behavioural needs. Although Miso does enjoy physical contact, he can also find it overwhelming and has in the past used certain behaviours such as growling and snapping to communicate this. Because of this we are looking for a home with owners who have a level of experience and or knowledge of dogs with behavioural needs such as Miso’s.

Miso enjoys his walks and spending time with his handlers. He may be small but he’s full of life!

Miso enjoys meeting other dogs and can make friends quickly. He can also become quickly frustrated around other dogs. Miso will need continued support with this and ideally access to low dog populated walking areas too where this can be worked on successfully. Miso could live with another suitable companion that has lived with dogs before.

Miso is looking for an adult home only, without any small animals or cats.

Miso can find being left alone worrying so is looking for owners who will be home during the day to help him feel secure and settle him in to a new routine.

Please adopt Miso",09/15/2025
Rosie,/sites/default/files/d8/styles/landscape_large/public/974896.jpg.webp?itok=M-jpcD1D,https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet/rosie-1166790,4 years 8 months,Female,Crossbreed - Large,Suffolk rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Say hello to Rosie, a larger-than-life lady with a heart as big as her paws!

This strong and spirited girl is full of character and brings joy wherever she goes. She’s smart, sassy, and showing great progress with her training – especially when it comes to good manners on the lead and listening to her people.

Rosie is incredibly affectionate – a real cuddle bug who adores sofa snuggles and being close to her humans. Her ideal day involves a bit of exploring, a bit of learning, and a whole lot of love.

She’s looking for a home in a quieter, lower dog-populated area where she can enjoy her walks without feeling overwhelmed. Rosie thrives in a calm environment where she can relax, have fun, and continue to build confidence.

Rosie is looking for:

A quieter area for stress-free walks

A loving home where cuddles are in abundance

Continued positive reinforcement training to help her flourish

A home without other dogs or a cat

If you're after a loyal companion with tons of charm, Rosie could be your perfect match. She's ready to fill your life with laughter, love, and a little bit of cheeky mischief.

Could Rosie be your next adventure buddy?

Due to her size Rosie will need to be walked by someone physically capable of managing her. Large bull breeds are not usually suited to first time or inexperienced dog owners, and we always recommend anyone thinking about adopting or buying a large bull breed to thoroughly research the dog’s background beforehand.

Please adopt Rosie",09/15/2025
Nemo,/sites/default/files/d8/styles/landscape_large/public/963457.jpg.webp?itok=zWTXhkZF,https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet/nemo-1171842,10 years 0 months,Male,Alaskan Malamute,Oxfordshire: Burford rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Brave and beloved Nemo is on the hunt for new owners, could that be you?

This handsome boy loves nothing more than mooching around saying hello to anyone that is passing by, however be warned, his most animated greetings are saved for his favourite people - they often involve prancing, maybe a toy or two in his mouth, and a sweet 'awwooo'!

Despite his age and being a bit arthritic, Nemo loves being out and about on walks, sniffing the hedgerows and exploring his surroundings. In his mind, age is just a number and with a bit of pain relief he acts like a 2-year-old! He very much enjoys using his brain too, scent games, snuffle mats, puzzle feeders, you name it, Nemo has tried and loved it.

Travelling isn't an issue for this explorer, so if his new owners want to go on dog friendly holidays or do a lot of driving, he would be more than happy to join them as he loves nothing more than the wind in his fur and having a nosey through the windows.

New owners need to be aware of his prey drive though, he hasn't mellowed in his old age and will chase small furry animals if given the chance, so he can't live with cats. Nemo will be able to give with school age children, but will need to be the only pet in his new home.

He is social with other dogs when out on walks regardless of their size, age, or behaviour, so is happy to make walking friends, however he can be a tad too keen to put his nose where it doesn't belong and for a tad too long, so we are looking for owners who can notice and manage this - the team here at the centre can show you what this looks like. Nemo could share his home with a well matched dog of similar age or lifestyle.

Nemo has previously been left for up to an hour and a half, but will need some help building back up to this after his stay in kennels.

If you have space in your heart and home for the most deserving of dogs, please get in touch today!

Please adopt Nemo",09/15/2025

Cross",West Midlands: Bromsgrove rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Meet handsome Hugo!

Hugo is looking for an active home that would be able to take him on many adventures and to meet dog friends along the way. After time exploring, he will happily spend some time cuddled up in his bed.

Hugo would benefit from being taught slightly better manners on lead as he can be strong to begin with. He would also like new owners who understand when he may need some mental stimulation through snuffle mats and other enrichment activities too.

Bouncy, energetic and loving Hugo would enjoy a game of tug with new friends but adores chasing after a ball that you've thrown for him the most. He can be clumsy at times when bouncing around so we would say that he could live with older school-aged children 14+.

Due to being a bigger breed, Hugo will need to be walked by someone physically capable of managing him.

Please adopt Hugo",09/15/2025

**Elvis is looking for a home local to Devon**

Elvis is a beautiful boy looking for a home where he can shine like the star he is!

He is a playful and affectionate boy that would love a home that enjoys going on adventures and learning new tricks when the opportunity arises! He would be better for someone to be around most of the time to start with to build up his time alone as he has always had company previously.

This handsome guy has a lot of energy and is eager to please with learning new things. He has loved doing various enrichment each day which he would love to continue this in the new home.

Although Elvis is dog social with the correct introductions, he is still learning manners and how to manage his excitement levels around other dogs. We believe he would be best to be the only dog in the home for now to help him focus on building his confidence and independence.

Elvis would love a home where he can blossom, could he be the one for you?

Cross",Hertfordshire rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Meet this handsome lively boy, Hugo!

Hugo is a young busy pup who doesn’t like to stay still for too long, with his high energy levels Hugo is looking for an active family, who will enjoy accompanying him on long regular walks exploring and sniffing whatever the weather! So, if keeping up your steps is something you like to do then Hugo would be the perfect pal for you! He also loves to say hello to doggie pals and human friends when he is out on his walks and is zealous with his greetings!

Hugo is a clever boy who needs a patient family who would like to engage and support him with training to use his young brain, so that he can become the best version of himself. Hugo needs a family who will enjoy training as much as him, whilst he learn some doggie training skills.

Hugo’s energy does continue into the home as he loves to play with everything and have a run around the garden. Hugo will need continued support with learning to switch off and engage in downtime in the home, BlueCross will offer guidance on this.

This bouncy boy would be better suited to live with older children as he can be very bouncy and quite animated during play, and they would need to know when Hugo would need his own space to settle.

Hugo could have dog friends to join on walks in his new home, but would find it too exciting to live with another dog. Due to having a high prey drive Hugo cannot live with cats or smallies as they would be too fun to chase!

Please apply below if you are interested in adopting this fantastic boy.

Meet the lovely the Todd.

Todd is a sweet boy who enjoys taking his time to get to know you before showing his affectionate side. Once settled, he absolutely loves a cuddle, whether that’s snuggling up next to you or curling up with his favourite soft toy.

While he’s happy to give a polite hello to smaller, calm dogs, he prefers not to approach most dogs and keeps a polite distance from them. He would therefore thrive in a home where he doesn’t have to meet many dogs when he’s out and about and would need to be the only dog in the home where he can relax and enjoy a fuss without feeling overwhelmed.

Todd could live with older children who understand that he may initially need a bit of space. His ideal home would be with someone who is home most of the day to help him settle in and time alone can be gradually built.

Todd has some ongoing medical, which is currently managed with medication. His new owners would need to be help to support this.

If you’re looking for a gentle, loving friend to share your life with, Todd could be the perfect match so pleas apply today.

His sleek coat and striking features make him stand out, but it’s his warm personality that truly wins hearts.

His playful spirit and lovable antics never fail to bring smiles to everyone he meets. Whether he’s exploring the outdoors or relaxing at home, Elvis’s friendly nature makes him an instant favorite.

While he’s generally confident, Elvis can be a little cautious around other dogs, so he would thrive best as the only pet in his new home. His new family will need to support him with gentle guidance and ongoing training to help him feel secure out and about. Elvis walks beautifully on a lead and is happy to wear a muzzle when needed. He would enjoy a calm home with older children who can give him the space he needs to settle comfortably.

This gentle giant is Timber! He is a beautiful, friendly and intelligent boy with so much love and joy to offer a new home. He has some ongoing training as he is still a young bouncy dog but is social boy that loves fuss from anyone he meets. He enjoys play time with different toys and is engaged with learning new things when training.

He is an energetic boy that needs a lot of mental and physical stimulation, he particularly enjoys food puzzles and games to keep him busy when he isn’t going on long explorations. He can be left however, we would recommend building this slowly to start with as he gets used to a new environment and routine.

He is dog social and could potentially live with another dog that have a similar temperament to Timber. He would be best not to live with a cat due to his excitement levels around them out of the house. He could live with school aged children that are comfortable with a big, bouncy boy!

Whiskey,,https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet/whiskey-1175062,0 years 11 months,Female,Crossbreed - Large,Hertfordshire rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Meet Whiskey,

Whiskey is a bundle of fun and keeps everyone entertained with her puppy-like antics. As Whiskey is only 10 months old, she is looking for a home where she will be given guidance and ongoing training so she can grow up to be the best version of herself. At the centre, Whiskey has been keen to learn and likes to show off her 'sits' and 'downs'.

Whiskey can be a little underconfident at times and will need new owners who can read her body language and know when she is uncomfortable. Whiskey is friendly and affectionate with people she knows and loves getting all the fuss and attention.

Whiskey has been keen to greet dogs, but can be very over-excited so will need some support to encourage polite interactions. Whiskey could live with a tolerant dog that will be comfortable with her full-on approach.

Whiskey can be quite bouncy and excitable at times and is best suited to a home with older children.

Whiskey can be strong on lead when she is excited and will need new owners who can manage this.

If you are interested in giving this lovely girl a home, please fill out an application form!

Meet Sazzy!

This sweet gentleman is on the look out for new owners who can show him what pet life is all about, in a slow paced home with a big sofa for him to snooze on.

Sazzy needs to learn all the basics in life, with a new family who have the time to help him grown in confidence and get used to a home environment. He is looking for a new home with a secure garden to explore in and help with toilet training, and with someone around for most of the day so that any time left alone could be built up gradually at his own pace.

He loves to be with his familiar people, and will look to them for reassurance with a gentle lean in to you and enjoys a fuss or good bum scratch! He won't say no to a treat or two either.

Sazzy could share his new home with school age children. Sazzy has lots of experience making friends with fellow Greyhounds but he is less familiar with other breeds of dog. He is slowly building confidence meeting a wide variety of dogs on his walks if they are calm and steady so he may be able to share his new home with a well matched dog, especially another sighthound! But no cats or small furries as he would chase them!

If you have a greyhound shaped hole in your life, and the time to help settle Sazzy in. Please apply today.

Please be aware, Sazzy is awaiting a dental and will need this doing before being rehomed.

Orchid,,https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet/orchid-1175063,2 years 7 months,Female,French Bulldog,Hertfordshire rehoming centre,,Blue Cross,"About me

Meet beautiful Orchid,

Orchid is the sweetest of girls who loves a chew on a tough toy and a snooze next to her favourite people.

She loves nothing more than getting out on her walks, taking in the scents and sights. She is super friendly, happily greeting new people she meets. When seeing other dogs on walks she can be keen to pull and meet but quite underconfident during the interaction. New owners would need to support Orchid with her training, reading her body language and follow the guidance of BlueCross staff to encourage calmer interactions and help build her confidence.

After her adventures, Orchid can be found having a chew on a toy before falling asleep. She is an affectionate, easy-going girl and is happiest when in the company of her favourite people lapping up all the attention.

Orchid could live with older teenagers that are able to read her body language and give her space when needed.

She would prefer to be the only pet in the home. She cant live with cats or smallies due to them being too interesting to chase.

Flat faced (brachycephalic) dogs suffer from additional health problems, which may impact their quality of life. We always recommend anyone thinking about adopting or buying a flat faced dog to thoroughly research the breed beforehand. Our expert team will be able to give you tips on exercise and weight management and advice on any support that may be needed.

If you can offer this lovely girl a home, please apply below.

Meet the wonderful duo - Ashley and Bella!

Ashley is being rehomed as a pair with Bella. These two girls have a lovely relationship and bring out the best in each other. They could live with another dog, and potentially be rehomed with a confident teenager that don't mind a bit of barking and jumping up when these two get excited.

Ashley is a sweet, sensitive miniature poodle with a big heart and an even bigger love for her humans.

She’s the type of dog who wants to be by your side all day—following you from room to room and happily curling up on your lap whenever she gets the chance. Her affectionate and loyal nature makes her an ideal companion.

Ashley has often looked to her sister Bella for reassurance at the centre, especially in unfamiliar settings. She can be a little underconfident meeting other dogs on her walks, but keen to try and make friends!

She’s playful and active, and her favourite thing is being close to the people she loves.

Please apply if you would like to offer these lovely sisters a home!

Bella is being rehomed as a pair with Ashley. These two girls have a lovely relationship and bring out the best in each other. They could live with another dog, and potentially be rehomed with a confident teenager that don't mind a bit of barking and jumping up when these two get excited.

Bella is a gorgeous miniature poodle with a love for playtime and adventures. She is a confident and curious girl, often found playing independently or having a snooze after a good play session or walk. She's especially motivated by toys—drop a ball at her feet and she’ll be ready for an endless game of fetch!

Bella is polite and comfortable when greeting other dogs on her walks. She sometimes has a quick play but is just as happy saying hello then continuing on doing her own thing.

Meet sweet Sophie!

She is a beautiful girl looking for a home where she can shine like the super star she is!

She is a playful and affectionate girl that would love a home that enjoys going on adventures and learning new tricks when the opportunity arises!

She would be better for someone to be around most of the time to start with to build up her time alone whilst she settles in and finds her paws.

This sweetheart has plenty of energy still and is eager to please with learning new things. She has loved doing various enrichment each day which she would love to continue with in the new home.

Although Sophie is dog social with the correct introductions, she is still learning manners and how to manage herself around other dogs. We believe she would be best to be the only dog in the home for now to help her focus on building confidence and her independence.

Sophie would love a home where she can blossom, could she be the one for you?

Meet Peggy, a gorgeous girly ready to embark on her next chapter. Peggy has a lively spirit and a bright, cheerful personality that lights up every room. Her joyful energy and affectionate nature make her a wonderful companion for those who appreciate a sweet, girly girl with a zest for life. Peggy loves her humans dearly and enjoys curling up on your lap, making her a perfect partner for relaxing evenings at home.

While she adores her walks, Peggy can sometimes feel a little worried around other dogs. To ensure she feels safe and comfortable, she would thrive as the only dog in the household, with walks scheduled when she’s less likely to encounter too many four-legged friends. She would benefit from a secure garden where she can bask in the sun and have a little playtime, adding to her happiness and well-being.

Peggy is a gentle lady who may be a bit apprehensive at the vets, so an understanding owner who can offer patience and support during formal handling will be ideal. She could share her home with older children who are respectful and willing to give her the time and space she needs to settle in and feel secure. Peggy’s zest for life and loving nature make her a wonderful addition to a caring family ready to give her the love and stability she deserves.

Meet Dolly!

A sweet girl who loves being active and playing with her toys, with her ball being the favourite!

Dolly enjoys her walks and will enjoy having multiple walks a day, unless it is raining, then Dolly prefers not to get her paws wet! Dolly did used to work on a farm so is kept on lead on walks just in case there happens to be anything to chase, she does follow commands well so once a bond is built in the new home it could be an option to have off lead time in a secure area.

When it is time to settle, Dolly shows off her sweet side, often loving a fuss and snuggling up with you on the sofa. When it is time for saying goodnight she will happily move off onto her own bed unless you invite her sleep with you, she would love to join you!

Dolly will need support during the firework season, having a safe space and lots of reassurance helps Dolly during these times.

My details

Staffordshire Bull Terrier 

 Female

 8 Years Old

The perfect home

Currently thriving in her foster home, she’s been showing us just how wonderful family life could be with her – and she’s certainly proven herself to be the queen of sofa snuggles!

Once she’s had a little time to get to know you, Nova’s affectionate side shines through, and she’ll happily lap up every cuddle and fuss you have to offer. She also has a fun, cheeky streak and loves playtime with her toys – it’s impossible not to smile when she’s in her element!

Nova would love to be the only dog in her new home, where she can soak up all the love and attention she deserves. Out on walks, she’s happy to have doggy pals, though she can be a little selective at times, so continued confidence-building will help her flourish.

This sweet girl is already house-trained, walks beautifully on the lead, and once settled, can be left for short periods. Nova could share her home with children aged 10+, who will no doubt adore her loyal and loving nature.

Nova is looking for a family who can offer her the care, companionship, and cuddles she craves – in return, she’ll be the most devoted best friend you could wish for.

My details

 Patterdale

  Male

  3 Years Old

The perfect home

True to his breed, Fowler is full of beans and brimming with personality. He adores exploring new places, following his nose wherever it leads, and once he’s checked out every corner, he’s more than happy to come back for fuss and affection.

Out and about, Fowler can be a bit enthusiastic on the lead, but thanks to his size he’s very manageable, especially once he settles into the walk. He’s a bright boy who will thrive with an owner who enjoys adventures and is happy to channel his energy into fun activities.

Fowler could live with children aged 10 years and above who are confident around lively dogs. He’s affectionate and playful, but like many terriers, he can sometimes be a little excitable, so older children who can join in with his training and enjoy his cheeky nature would be a great match.

Fowler’s favourite things? Cheese, chasing after balls, and heading out on new adventures with his people! He is best suited as the only pet in the home – he has a high chase drive and will need a home without cats or small animals, and no other dogs. This way, he can soak up all the attention (and all the cheese!) for himself.

If you’re looking for a lively, loyal companion who will keep you on your toes and fill your life with fun, Fowler could be your perfect match.

This sweet Pug has been in a foster home since birth, where she’s been busy building her confidence, learning her puppy manners, and charming absolutely everyone she meets.

My details

Pug

 Female

 17 Weeks Old

The perfect home

Promise could happily share her forever home with a well-matched dog friend (pending successful introductions at the centre). She has also grown up around cats and other animals, so with the right introductions, she’d settle in well alongside them too.

Like all puppies, Promise will need patient adopters who are ready to support her through training, socialisation, and all the fun (and challenges!) of puppyhood. She’s playful, affectionate, and never says no to a good game or a cuddle.

Promise is suspected to have a heart condition called aortic stenosis. This means one of her heart valves may be narrower than normal, causing her heart to work a little harder to pump blood around her body. However, as she is still so young and small, it isn’t possible to give a confirmed diagnosis just yet. She will need to grow a little more before having a repeat heart scan

Promise doesn’t let this hold her back one bit – she’s every inch a typical bouncy, happy puppy who loves exploring, playing, and soaking up affection. Her forever family should be prepared to give her the same experiences, training, and adventures as any other pup, while being mindful of her ongoing health needs.

If you can keep the promise of a loving, understanding home, this little girl will repay you tenfold with affection, loyalty, and endless  Pug wiggles!

Could you be the one to give Promise her happily ever after?

True to his breed, Fernando is a big-hearted boy who thrives on companionship, play, and having people by his side. 

My details

 American Bulldog Cross

  Male

  2 Years Old

The perfect home

He’s a brilliant mixer with other dogs, socially confident, and even adjusts his greeting and playstyle depending on who he’s meeting. His play can sometimes be a little over the top, but he shows good inhibition and always has the best intentions. Fernando could potentially live with a well-matched dog, pending successful introductions at the centre

With people, Fernando is typically very confident and tactile – he’s a full-body contact kind of lad who adores fuss and attention. In more confined spaces with new people he can feel a little unsure at first, but with gentle introductions he soon shows off his affectionate, cuddly side.

Fernando may also be able to share his home with older children (14+) who are comfortable and confident around large, excitable breeds.

Fernando is intelligent, loyal, and will thrive in a home that can provide him with structure, training, and positive experiences. He may show some slight anxiety in new or novel situations, but with reassurance and gradual exposure in the home, his confidence will only continue to grow.

If you’re looking for a devoted, playful, and affectionate companion who will give you all of his love (and then some), Fernando could be the perfect match.

My details

 Border Collie 

 Female

 14 Weeks Old

The perfect home

Mable is already showing what a special little Border Collie she is. Currently thriving in a loving foster home, she’s been described as “good as gold” and it’s easy to see why. She’s sweet, smart, and full of potential.

Mable is a typical young collie in all the best ways: clever, energetic, and eager to learn. She’s looking for a home that understands the needs of this intelligent working breed – one that can keep her mind and body active with plenty of enrichment, training, and fun. Whether it’s agility, scent work, or puzzle toys, Mable loves anything that keeps her busy and engaged.

She’s a big fan of her toys, gets along beautifully with other dogs, and is even happy around cats. With the right introduction, she could also live with children who are familiar with the needs of an active, energetic breed. Her ideal home would be one that not only gives her lots of love and playtime but is also committed to ongoing positive, reward-based training to help her grow into the brilliant dog she’s destined to be.

If you’re ready for a bright, loving pup who’ll bring joy, energy, and endless companionship into your life, Mable might just be the perfect match.

My details

Cane Corso 

  Male

 2 Year Old

The perfect home

He originally came into us from the pound and has found kennel life a little worrying. We have found he can be easily spooked by loud noises and unfamiliar situations but with his handlers nearby to give him encouragement his affectionate and goofy personality begins to shine through. 

We have found food is definitely the way to his heart, and this is a great tool for his ongoing training needs. He’s currently learning to walk nicely on a head collar as he can be very strong on lead. We have introduced Gordon to other dogs and found he gets on well with them when out and about, but he finds it hard to manage his excitement and can get over-excited in play, so he’ll need to be the only pet in the home for now, but he would thrive with walking buddies out and about. 

As he’s likely never lived in a home before, Gordon isn’t yet house trained and will need patient, consistent routines to help him learn. He’s looking for an adult-only home with owners who are around during the day and have experience with large, sensitive breeds. 

A quiet, predictable environment will help him settle and flourish at his own pace. He will need a child free home and cannot live with cats. 
Gordon will make a super addition to a family who can give him the time and support he needs to build on his confidence.

 Raya - 9 Years Old, Sierra - 6 years old

The perfect home 

Raya and Sierra, are the perfect combination for one another, both enjoy their walks, the sniffier the environment the better. They walk gently on their leads and after a walk they love to curl up and it can be hard to determine where one dog stops and the other begins as they are so intertwined when curling up together. Raya can be worried around other dogs and show this by barking towards them, they would therefore prefer to have their new home all to themselves!

They both enjoy the company of their human companions although Sierra can be reserved initially. For this reason they can be rehomed with children aged 14+.

Both girls try to be desperately clean in their kennel so we are sure they will pick up house training quickly. They will need to have the time they are left home alone built up gradually.

Border Collie

 Male Female

 Ready for Adoption after 20th September 

The perfect home

Just like their song, they’ll be keeping you on your toes! Collies are clever, active dogs, and these pups will need homes that can keep their busy brains working to their full potential as they grow. Activities such as flyball, agility, and scent work will be a fantastic outlet for their energy – because a little bit of mental stimulation goes a long way!

They could live with other dogs, pending successful introductions here at the centre, and may also be able to live with dog-savvy cats given careful, positive introductions. They could join families with children who are used to the breed and understand their playful, energetic nature.

As with all puppies, they’ll need someone home for most of the day to help them with house training, socialisation, and all the important life lessons. Reward-based, positive training will help them grow into the wonderful dogs we know they can be.

If you’ve need “a little bit of Monica in your life” (or maybe an Angela, Pamela, Sandra or Rita), and plenty of love, time, and energy to give, then one of these pups could be your perfect match.

My details

 Lurcher 

 Female

 4 years old

The perfect home

Whilst we have introduced Sara to other dogs we have found she tends to prefer things on her terms. She often gets on well with male dogs and some calm females, and will enjoy a brief play session now and then, but if another dog gets too much, she will let them know she wants some space!

She’s a lovely mix of independent and affectionate, happy to potter about with her toys or do zoomies in our paddocks, but also enjoys a fuss with her handlers after she’s got all of her energy out of course! She may need a little help settling into home life, including toilet training and getting used to being left alone, however she is  quick learner so this should take too long.

She is currently looking for a home where any children present are aged 14 and over as although she does enjoy a cuddle and a play she does like time to herself so would prefer a quieter home life for some down time after her walks and adventures.

If you’re looking for a fun, smart and slightly sassy sidekick, Sara could be your perfect match.

This lovely lad enjoys his walks and mostly walks nicely on the lead, making him a great companion for anyone who loves getting out and about.

More than anything, Fly is interested in his handler and thrives on quality time and affection.

Fly is good with other dogs and could live alongside a canine companion, pending successful meets at the centre. He has also been around children before and could live with children aged 10+, as long as they’re confident and respectful around dogs. Due to his high chase drive, Fly isn’t able to live with small furries.

My details

 Collie 

 Female

 3 years

The perfect home

Always on the go, Paisley’s quick to recharge after a power nap and ready for action again. It’s essential to keep her brain as active as her body! Her love for both toys and food makes her highly trainable.

Paisley does have a strong chase instinct, especially towards birds and vehicles, because of this, she would thrive in a quieter area away from busy roads.

Paisley is currently in foster with other dogs and could do so again in her new home with a well matched dog. She could potentially live with a dog savvy cat. She can be worried if she thinks her valuable items such as toys or treats are going to be taken from her, so having a safe space in the home where she can retreat with her things would be ideal.

In the car, she needs to be secured in a crate, as the sight of moving traffic can be overstimulating for her. Our team will be on hand to support adopters as Paisley settles in and adjusts to her new home. Paisley is best suited for an adult-only home.

Zuma LOVES other dogs and would be delighted to share his home with a playful canine companion, provided they’re happy to keep up with his excitable puppy energy. With the right match, he’ll make a fantastic playmate.

This busy boy adores fuss and affection, and after a fun, sniffy adventure in the woods, he’ll happily curl up in your lap for cuddles.

My details

Pug cross Retriever

  Male

  2 Years Old

The perfect home

Benedict is a real explorer and loves using his nose, scent work games will be a fantastic way to keep both his mind and body busy. He can be a little snatchy with food, so scattering his treats is a great way to manage this while also giving him the challenge of sniffing them out, which he thoroughly enjoys.

Out on walks, Benedict can sometimes become frustrated when he sees other dogs and may pull or bark in his eagerness to say hello. However, when he does get the chance to greet politely, he’s gentle, careful, and respectful of space. He’s playful and tolerant with other dogs, though he may look for reassurance if things feel a bit overwhelming. With ongoing support, positive experiences, and encouragement from his handler, Benedict will continue to build confidence and learn to manage his excitement around canine friends.

Benedict could potentially live with the right match canine companion, he can be worried by excitable and bouncy dog, so a calmer friend would be a must for him.

Because he’s such a busy and enthusiastic boy, Benedict would be best suited to a home with children aged 10+. He’d also love a family who can continue his training, keep him active, and channel his energy in positive ways.

With his affectionate nature, love of play, and waggy enthusiasm for life, Benedict is sure to bring plenty of joy to the right home.

My details

 Staffordshire Bull Terrier

 Female

 1 Years Old

The perfect home

This gentle soul can be a little wary when first meeting new people, but it doesn’t take long for her to warm up, especially if there are some tasty treats involved! Once she knows you, her affectionate and playful side really shines.

Sharon is a toy enthusiast through and through, with tug-of-war being her all-time favourite game, although she’s happy to join in with just about any kind of play. She also loves to get out and explore on her walks, taking in all the sights and smells the world has to offer.

She’s looking for a calm home with children aged 14+ and owners who can help her continue building her confidence around other dogs. For now, she’ll do best in quiet walking locations away from busy off-lead areas so she can relax and enjoy her outings, and is looking to be the only pet in the home.

Sharon can find veterinary visits and formal handling a little worrying, so she’ll need patient owners who can support her through a gentle “vet settle” routine and help her feel more comfortable in those situations.

With kindness, patience, and plenty of playtime, Sharon will blossom into a loyal, loving companion who’s always ready for a game and a cuddle. Could you be the one to help this lovely girl feel safe, loved, and at home?

Adopt Tetris,/images/ab3c9e67-5a42-422e-9e56-44c05974d256/cropped?width=600&height=338,https://www.hoperescue.org.uk/adopt-tetris,The perfect home, 7 Months Old,  Male,,cf72 9nh,Hope Rescue,"Young Tetris is a handsome lurcher lad has won the hearts of everyone he meets.

My details

Lurcher

  Male

 7 Months Old

The perfect home

Bright, eager, and a big fan of tasty treats, this clever boy will thrive in a home where his adopters are excited to put some time into basic training; with his quick mind and willingness to please, he’s bound to pick things up in no time.

Tetris absolutely adores the company of other dogs, but he can get a little frustrated when he can’t reach something (or someone) he wants, especially around new canine friends. Because of this, he would be best suited to a home with a calm, confident dog to show him the ropes, but will also engage in some fun playtimes. If he were to be an only dog, he’d need regular walks and opportunities to play with doggy companions to keep him happy and social.

This young chap has already spent time in foster care, where he’s grown in confidence living with another playful dog. He’s shown excellent manners around food, is doing brilliantly with his house training, and has proven to be a very polite house guest. Of course, he’s still a youngster, so he’ll need continued guidance with his toilet training and patience while building up the time he can be left alone, as being without his people can worry him.

Tetris is playful, affectionate, and full of fun - the perfect match for an active family who love training and adventures. If there are children in the home, they’ll need to be aged 14+ so Tetris has the calm, consistent environment he needs to thrive.

If you’re looking for a smart, loving, and fun-loving companion who’s ready to slot right into your life, Tetris might just be your missing piece.

Benjo has met other dogs during his stay with us and while he enjoys social walks, he can be a little too enthusiastic at times! He’s currently looking for a home as the only dog, so he can focus on learning his manners without distraction.

With the right support and lots of positive reinforcement, Benjo is sure to be a brilliant, cheeky addition to the right home.

This sweet girl loves to play, whether it’s chasing after a football, tugging on her favourite toy, or proudly carrying around a squeaky teddy, Tegan’s enthusiasm is infectious. Out on walks, she can get a little excitable, but she’s quick to focus when there are tasty treats involved, making her a joy to train. Her new family will enjoy helping her build confidence while also channelling her playful energy in positive ways.

Tegan adores fuss and affection once she feels comfortable, and she’d love to be the only pet in the home so she can soak up all the love for herself. As she’s still learning to relax around other dogs, patient and understanding adopters will be key to helping her continue to grow.

My details

 Rime - Pointer cross Cloud - Pointer

 Females

 6 Years Old

The perfect home 

Rime and Cloud are in some ways chalk and cheese and in others, they are two peas in a pod!

Both girls have come from a multi dog household and have shown to have a very close bond. They would be happy to share their new home with another dog also, pending successful meets at the centre to gradually build their confidence.

Rime can be reserved when meeting new people whereas Cloud is first in line for fuss. This helps to give Rime confidence in these situations. Once Rime gets to know you she firmly believes she is of lapdog size, so a family who is keen for sofa snuggles is a must!

Due to Rime’s initial apprehension, both girls will need to be rehomed to a family where there aren’t any children present.

Both girls are spotless in their kennel so we are confident it won’t take them long to pick up on their house training. They can often be seen curling up with one another and this helps to give them comfort when left home alone. 

If you are interested in offering a forever home to our gorgeous girls, please do enquire!

My details

German Shepherd Cross 

  Male

  6 Years Old

The perfect home

Biggie is currently looking for a pet-free, adult-only home where he can be the centre of attention. We have introduced Biggie to other dogs and after an initial shout toward them he does settle and does enjoy walking alongside them, we have also started to see glimpses of play toward other dogs so walking companions would be ideal for him to continue to build on his social skills.


When spending time off lead he does enjoy doing zoomies around the paddock which can include some playful mouthing when he’s overexcited but with a few treats to distract him he soon calm down. When it comes to mud, though, all bets are off as Biggie adores muddy puddles. When walking if he sees a puddle he aims for it and goes straight to lying down, rubbing his face and body through the muck, in true mucky pup style though he is not a fan of a clean bath or shower but will stand for a clean if a tasty treat is on offer.
Biggie can be strong on the lead at first but does settle after the initial excitement. 


He is currently looking for adopters who are around during the day whilst he settles in to build up any time he is left slowly. He is very clean in his kennel so toilet training shouldn’t take too long with him.


If you’re looking for an adventure dog who does enjoy chilling at the end of the day then Biggie is an ideal match!

 Female

 5 Years Old

The perfect home

Luna can happily walk next to other dogs whilst out exploring; however, she would prefer to be the only dog in the home so she can soak up all the attention.

Luna is doing really well with her house training but may need a little support as she settles into her new home. She's been left up to 3 hours in her foster home and coped well with this. She enjoys food time but she is currently on a diet to help her stay in tip top shape.

Luna would be better suited to a calm home with children aged 10 years and above who can respect her space and gentle nature.

If you are looking for a future snuggle buddy, Luna could be the one for you!

My details

 Husky

 Female

 4 Years Old

The perfect home

Thanks to patient handling and plenty of kindness, she has made great progress and is now ready to find a very special home. She will need calm, understanding adopters who can offer her a safe environment and allow her to continue learning that people aren’t so scary.

With those she knows, Tiger-Lily has formed a lovely bond and enjoys interacting with her favourite people, but she can still find new people and situations overwhelming. We know there’s a huge amount of love in her heart, and in the right home she will truly flourish.

Due to her worries, Tiger-Lily will need an adult-only home with a secure garden where fencing is at least 6ft. One thing that has really helped her come out of her shell is the company of another dog, when she’s with a friendly, playful companion, she relaxes and lets her joyful, puppy-like side shine.

For this reason, she must be rehomed with an existing well-rounded dog who can offer companionship and be a positive role model. Her new family should be prepared to come to the centre on multiple occasions to build a bond with her and when she’s ready to go home, her new owners should be aware she may need support her with ongoing toilet training and gradually building up the time she can be left alone.

With time, patience, and the right canine friend, Tiger-Lily will reward her adopters with loyalty, affection, and moments of pure joy.

Mav is a friendly lad who likes a good squish and a fuss from his humans. Maverick hasn’t had much training input previously and is still learning some of his basic skills. He is looking for new owners that will dedicate some time to his training. Maverick can live with confident children of 14+ who are used to larger dogs.  

Maverick loves other dogs but can find himself a bit frustrated on lead when he cannot say hello. Maverick can be vocal on lead around dogs and needs some support with this. The behaviour team at Hope can help guide new owners on how to best help Mav on his walks. Maverick would benefit from living at home with a well matched and well rounded dog who can provide him with the companionship he seeks from other dogs and build his confidence when seeing other dogs out and about. 

Mav is looking for new owners who could be around the majority of the day as he would need the time he is left home alone to be built up gradually. Maverick may need support with his house training .

This gorgeous boy is Cheddar, he is a 10 year old Terrier looking for his forever home. Cheddar is looking for a home as the only pet as he loves to have all the love and attention to himself. He can live with children of secondary school age that will give him some time to settle when he needs a power nap. Cheddar prefers his own space from dogs so would prefer quieter walks away from the hustle and bustle of lots of dogs, he does however love meeting new people. Cheddar is an amazing boy and is really thriving in his foster home!

Is Cheddar right for you?

Cheddar’s foster carers would describe him as, quiet, gentle, playful, cheeky and is great company and a pleasure to have in their home. Despite Cheddar’s age, he very much still enjoys his walks and exploring his surroundings. Since Cheddar has been in foster he is completely housetrained and will ask to go to the toilet if he needs to.

Pingu is on the search for his forever home with patient adopters who can build his confidence and take things at his own pace. Pingu has shown worries around men- therefore there may be a longer introduction/adoption process if there are men in the home. He can be shy around handling and therefore would be best suited to live with older teenagers in the home who can respect his space. Pingu could live with another dog in the home. We do not have any history of him living with cats but feel that he could have the potential (pending a scent swap). He can also live with small furries and other animals. Pingu must go to a home with a private and secure garden. Once settled, he can be left for up to 4 hours if built up slowly. Pingu does have some medical considerations that will be discussed with our vet team upon a booking.

Is Pingu right for you?

Pingu is a great little dog with bundles of character. He loves curling up for a snooze with his handlers close by and would be sure to be someone’s shadow in a home setting. He hasn’t shown lots of interest in toys but we are hoping with time he will learn to find the joy in them. He loves showing off his handsome sit, paw and stay for a tasty treat.

He will need to be the only pet in the home but would love a family that is happy to keep on working on his doggy social skills.

He is also used to being left for longer periods of time on his own but would prefer a home that could build up his leaving hours gradually while he settles. Chamber is in our care through our Homestay scheme which means that he isn't based here at the rehoming centre. Favourite Chamber on your application if you wish to hear more about him!

She can live with older primary school aged children. She would like to be the only dog in the home but would like calm walking friends out on her adventures. It is not essential for Angel to go to a home with a garden pending that she gets enough opportunity to go outside. Angel could live in a flat, but she does struggle with stairs so would be best suited to ground floor living. She does have some medical considerations that will be discussed with out vet team upon a booking.

Is Angel right for you?

Angel is a sweet older lady looking for a retirement home to call her own. She loves going on walks with calm doggy friends- strolling with her carers and taking in the World. After a walk, Angel loves some fuss and snacks from her handlers before curling up for a long snooze in her bed.

Edie is a gorgeous 6yr old Shar Pei who is the sweetest, most playful, and snuggly girl once she knows you. We are looking for a super special adopters for Edie as she is quite nervous of new people so you'll need to come and get to know her gradually, but believe us when we say that all the time and effort is worth it! As you'd expect from a Underdog like Edie, she needs a calm and predictable environment where she can settle and build her confidence gradually. This means that she'll need to be the only pet in an adult only home with no visiting children and few visitors in general due to her worries around unknown people. She will need you to be around all the time initially, not for constant attention as she likes to chill most of the time, but she just likes to know you're there. In time she will be ok to be left for periods on her own. She'll need a secure garden with 5ft fence, so she has somewhere to play and explore off-lead as she loves to do this.

Is Edie right for you?

Her handlers all adore her due to her zest for life. She loves getting out for walkies or playing with her toys and she's absolutely smashed her training. She really enjoys showing off and you can see her confidence grow each time she learns a new trick. She makes great use of that enormous nose and loves playing scent work games such as tracking and man trailing. She walks really nicely on lead too! She's been for sleep-overs to her handlers home and she was just perfect! Very relaxed, fully housetrained, and happy to just chill out. She's already proven that she'll make someone the most wonderful companion. She just needs some time and patience to get to know her initially. Add her to your favourites if you think you might be the PAWfect match she's looking for.",09/15/2025

Johnny is a nervous boy looking for a patient family with children older than 16. He could live with another dog but he is very boisterous in play so the other dog would need to enjoy this too. He is likely to require quite a few meetings at the centre before going home as it takes him a long time to build trust in strangers. We have no history for Johnny and cannot guarantee that he is house trained or used to being left alone for any length of time.

Is Johnny right for you?

Young Johnny came into our care as an unclaimed stray and he's looking for a special family to turn his life around. He is a very nervous boy but does well with a slow approach and we've already seen his confidence increase. Johnny has gone from hiding on the inside part of his kennel to happily greeting his handlers at his door but he will still hide from strangers. We don't know what he has been through but at such a young age Johnny should be lively and inquisitive, instead he is worried about being handled and meeting new people. His adopters must be wiling to spend time getting to know him and gaining his trust at the centre before taking him home. Johnny is definitely more keen on saying hello to people if those people have nibbles! The more time he spends with people the more comfortable he visibly becomes, so the slow approach is definitely the way forward for him. Johnny enjoys spending time with other dogs and this has also boosted confidence, and we think living with another dog would be good for him although it's not essential. Johnny is only a year old and has so much potential, he just needs the right family to guide him.",09/15/2025

Meet Limpet...he's a lovable four year old Cane Corso cross who is keen to move into his new forever home or to find a foster family. Limpet needs a calm, adult-only environment and confident adopters who understand the quirks that come with this breed. With new visitors, he’ll need one careful introduction — but once you’re in his circle, you’re in for life. He never forgets a friend (or a treat). As his name suggests, Limpet will be by your side through thick and thin! His adopters would benefit from having experience of larger breeds and he would need to be the only dog in the home, and a home without cats or small furries. Limpet is vocal around other dogs and although he can make doggie friends, he is most relaxed on quieter walks. He’s well behaved in the home, housetrained and content being left home alone. This sweet boy has ongoing health conditions and really deserves the opportunity to be pampered in a home. If you're concerned about medical costs, please don’t let that hold you back—we’d be more than happy to chat and see how we can support both you and Limpet together.

Is Limpet right for you?

Limpet’s a big softie, who loves nothing more than a cuddle and being a couch potato. He's affectionate, loyal, goofy, and happiest when he’s snoozing next to his favourite person. Limpet is more of a lazy wanderer than a hiking companion. He enjoys short, slow strolls where he can sniff and amble at his own pace. Limpet thrives on mental stimulation. He’s a quick learner, knows plenty of tricks, and absolutely loves food-based training. He also enjoys playing chase and tug with his toys. If you've got a Limpet-shaped hole in your life then he is ready and waiting to fill it!",09/15/2025

Maurice is a handsome older gent, but don't let that fool you! He loves to be on the go and getting his houndy nose in mischief! He Loves people and enjoys spending time with his favourite people and isn't really a big fan of being left home alone. He would love to find a home where he can be given lots to do to keep him busy and he will certainly keep you on your toes! Maurice is a big fan of food and has been known to counter surf and has even learnt how to open cupboard doors to find some goodies, for this reasons his new family will need to be willing to have things such as stairgates in place so he can't get into things he shouldn't. Maurice loves his walks and really loves adventures and the great outdoors, he will make a wonderful adventure pal! He will need direct access to his own garden. Maurice could share his new home with children 4+ following a meeting here at the centre. He is friendly with other dogs, but can be vocal at times however he does prefer to have his own space so will need to be the only pet in his forever home. He can have walking friends out and about, however he does prefer calmer, polite dogs.

Otis is a sweet 3-year-old crossbreed who has joined us after spending most of his life in a home. He has been housetrained before, though he may need a little refresher as he settles into his new routine. Otis adores his favourite people and finds it hard being left on his own, so he’s looking for adopters who can be around for most of the day and help him gradually build up to spending time alone. Full of energy and enthusiasm, Otis is a bouncy, boisterous lad who can sometimes get a little overexcited. With the help of tasty treats, he’s learning his manners and is already working on polite greetings like learning to keep all four paws on the floor! Otis could live with children aged 14+ who are confident around lively dogs and can respect his space when needed. He isn’t suitable to live with cats due to his strong chase drive, and as we’re still assessing his interactions with other dogs, he’ll need to be the only dog in the household for now.

Is Otis right for you?

Clever, food-motivated, and eager to learn, Otis enjoys showing off his tricks and would thrive in a home that keeps his brain busy as well as his paws. He has an adventurous spirit and would make a fantastic companion for an active household that loves walking, hiking, and exploring the great outdoors.

Stanley has been housetrained in the past, though he may need a little refresher as he settles back into home life. He’s looking for a family where he can be the only pet, with access to quiet walks. While not vocal or reactive, he can feel overwhelmed if other dogs get too close. A true foodie, Stanley is very motivated by treats, which has helped him learn lots of new skills including becoming a pro at wearing his muzzle on walks (and looking very handsome while doing so!). Stanley is also used to being left for a full working day without any issues, as long as he has a comfy spot for a nap, an armchair is his favourite! We’d recommend gradually building up to this again with shorter breaks at first. Stanley does have history of living with younger children and with his friendly nature, Stanley could live with children aged 6+, provided they are confident around larger dogs.

Is Stanley right for you?

Kiwi is sweet little girl has found kennel life a bit overwhelming. We don’t know much about her past, but it’s clear the big wide world can feel quite scary for her. What Kiwi needs most is a calm, patient forever home where she’ll be given the time and space to settle, relax, and truly find her paws. A secure, private garden will be essential for Kiwi so she can safely play and explore at her own pace. Because her history is unknown, she’ll likely need some gentle support with housetraining and lead-walking. We recommend gradually building up any time being left alone. Kiwi already shows us her affectionate side and will paw at her carers for attention, but she can get overwhelmed if things move too fast. Her ideal family will be able to read her body language and give her the reassurance she needs. She’ll do best in a peaceful home with children 14+ where her worries will be respected. While we continue to assess her around other dogs, for now she’ll need to be the only pet in the home.

Is Kiwi right for you?

Kiwi is an inquisitive girlie, who enjoys watching the world. We're sure with some time and patience, she will enjoy adventures and discovering lots of new sniffs and sights.

Riley is a sweet and sensitive boy looking for a quiet, adult only home. He can be quite nervous around new people so his new family should be prepared to make multiple meets to the centre, though once he knows you, he is very affectionate.

Tipps can live with children over 14 but no other pets as she is very worried by unknown animals. She isn't used to spending time alone so will need someone there with her most of the day, and she will need all her basic training.

Is Tipps right for you?

Little Tipps has come form a multi dog household where she wasn't being properly cared for and can now look forward to a brighter future with a loving family. She's a nervous girl by nature who resorts to barking worriedly when she's in a situation she's unsure of, and that can include meeting new people. Tipps is going to need slow introductions to the world from a family who are happy to let her take her time and will help build her confidence. When she knows you she happily displays her sweet personality and loves to be snuggled up with you. For a dog who has never been walked on a lead before, Tipps has taken to it really well and seems comfortable, so we know she has so much potential to get used to new things. She absolutely LOVES toys! Her little eyes light up when when you pick one up for her and she will pounce on one and then carry it around proudly. Playtime is where she really seems to feel bold and we reckon this is the best way to win Tipps' heart and trust.",09/15/2025

Meet Billie! He is a very handsome 2 year old Lurcher with heaps of love and fun to bring into his special someone's life. Billie can be a little bit wary with new people, places and things, so his adopter will need to be understanding and willing to help him build his confidence up. Due to his more sensitive side, Billie will be best suited in an adult only home where he is the only pet. Although Billie can be wary at first, once he gets to know you he really lets his goofy side shine! Once he feels comfortable, he loves to zoom around in enclosed outdoor spaces and play with his toys. He has made great friendships with his Canine Carers and they can't help but giggle at his funny antics. Everyone says that he would be perfect for someone who loves to have fun as much as he does!

Is Billie right for you?

Billie is looking for a quiet home where he is brought out daily for sniffy walkies and an opportunity to stretch his legs in an enclosed area. He is crate trained and is great at jumping into the back seat of the car for adventures. Billie is still a young dog, so he has lots of potential when it comes to working on his confidence with new people, dogs and situations. He will need a couple of meets here at the Centre so you can chat to our amazing Training Team about all things Billie!

Meet Quaver, the bouncy 1 year old Labrador Cross! Quaver came into us as a stray so we have very little history on him, but he's now looking for an adult only home to call his own. Quaver can be quite excitable and doesn't realize his own size sometimes! Quaver would need to be the only pet in the home but would be happy to have doggy walking buddies out and about. Eventually, he could be left for up to 4 hours but this would need to be gradually built up in his new home. If you're looking for a friendly, playful dog that is ready to go on any adventure with you then Quaver would be your boy!

Is Quaver right for you?

Quaver is happy to travel in the car with no problems, he can jump in on his own with no worry. He does know some basic commands such as 'Sit' but would benefit from continuing his training, as with little history we're not sure how much he knows! Quaver can be very strong on the lead but is working with our training team to improve his manners when out walking and would love a family that would continue this work with him in the home. He absolutely loves his toys- his favourite game is playing tug with his rope toy and he's more than happy to keep bringing them back to you to keep the game going. He's looking for an active family that would be happy to take him on long walks so that he can explore to his heart's content.",09/15/2025

Shrimp is a young Bulldog who came into our care as a stray. When he arrived, he needed corrective surgery for double cherry eye. Thanks to our vet team, the procedure has been successfully completed, and he’s now receiving eye drops to support his recovery.

Shrimp is an absolute delight — fun, enthusiastic, and a total cuddle bug who adores human company. Because he’s still healing, his exercise is currently restricted, which means he’s always raring to go when it’s walk time! Once fully recovered, he’ll be able to enjoy running free in our enclosed garden area.

This boy takes everything in his stride. He loves exploring, is curious about the world around him, and simply enjoys life. Shrimp would benefit from some basic training classes to help him keep his manners in check, as he can get a little overexcited when something grabs his attention. With consistency, he’ll thrive in his new home.

Shrimp could potentially live with respectful children, other neutered dogs with a similar energy level, and even resident cats. All introductions will be carefully managed here at the centre.

If you’re looking for a fun-loving companion who will fill your home with joy, Shrimp may be the perfect match.

Illtrid is a young Poodle cross approximately 2-3 years old who arrived in our care in a very sorry state. His coat was severely matted, causing him a great deal of distress and discomfort.

 

After an emergency groom — which took two groomers over four hours to complete — Illtrid felt like a brand-new dog. He was finally free from the painful tight mats, and his overgrown claws were trimmed so he could walk properly again.

 

Illtrid has some lovely lead manners and is working hard to stay calm when stopping for breaks or waiting to cross the road. He’s so thrilled to be out and about that sitting still can be a bit of a challenge — his enthusiasm for life shines through in everything he does!

 

He is currently on a diet plan and is steadily losing weight, with his confidence growing day by day. Illtrid loves playing with his toys and is learning to share nicely.

 

Illtrid is looking for an active home with people who will continue his training and support his weight-loss journey. He would benefit from training classes to refresh his basics and keep up with consistency.

 

Due to his grooming needs and energetic nature, we’re looking for an adult-only, child-free home, ideally with people who have Poodle or similar breed experience. Keeping his coat in great condition will be essential, along with helping him become more comfortable with regular grooming.

 

Illtrid is a happy-go-lucky lad — young, active, and very much a work in progress. With the right family, he’s sure to thrive and become a wonderful lifelong companion.

This little pocket-sized Bulldog is around 12–18 months old. Sadly, she arrived in our care in a very poor state. Her eyes were extremely sore, and due to untreated double cherry eye, she struggled to see clearly.

The good news is that Belle is now receiving the care she desperately needed. Once her infection clears up, our vet will proceed with her surgery. She’s already responding well to her treatment and showing her happy, cheeky side again.

Belle is currently thriving in her foster home, learning lots of new skills with the help of her foster doggy friend. She loves people and dogs alike — everyone wants to come and say hello to Belle, and she soaks up every bit of attention!

She’s looking for a home where she can continue to grow and develop. Any resident dogs will need to be tolerant of her playful manners, and she would benefit from attending training classes to help her build bonds and adjust to her new life.

Belle is a lovely balance of adventure and cuddles. She enjoys her walks but is also partial to an after-walk siesta and a good snuggle on the sofa. She’s polite in dog-friendly coffee shops and pubs, and won’t say no to a mid-walk snack if her humans fancy a pit stop!

Belle could potentially live with calm children and even cats, provided introductions go well at the centre.

Please note: Belle may require eye drops for life to prevent dryness, along with daily cleaning of her face folds and bottom area to keep her healthy and comfortable.

Belle is such a sweetheart — a mix of fun, affection, and resilience. Could you be the family to give her the bright future she deserves?

Belle is not currently ready for rehoming, she is however able to meet potential adopters.

once the vet has signed her off she will be able to be rehomed.

This little lady is Rizzo, a bundle of French Bulldog joy aged around 2-3  years old.

 

Rizzo came to us as an unclaimed stray, so we don’t know much about her past. What we do know is that life hasn’t always been kind. She arrived underweight, unkempt, and with teats that showed she’d been bred from multiple times. She was a worried girl with almost no confidence.

 

With time, love, and a steady routine, Rizzo has blossomed. A healthy diet, affection, and the safety of a caring environment have transformed her into a new dog. Today, she is happy, affectionate, and full of life. She enjoys her walks, is improving her lead manners, and has been joining our playgroup sessions, making great progress with her canine friends.

 

Rizzo is now ready to find her forever home — a family who will take her on adventures, share new experiences, and continue helping her grow. She would also benefit from ongoing training classes to strengthen her bond and consistency with her new people.

 

As a brachycephalic breed, we ask potential adopters to research her breed and be mindful of the health and care that comes with it.

 

If you’re looking for a fun-loving, loyal, and affectionate companion, Rizzo could be the perfect girl for you.

Please welcome to the hotel our gentle giant, Murray, an aproxinately 2 year old Mastiff cross who was brought into our care by a kind member of the public after being spotted straying for several days.

 

Since arriving in our care, Murray has blossomed in confidence and now walks with a spring in his step. He’s a firm favourite with our dog walkers and loves nothing more than exploring the world around him.

 

Murray’s playful side is pure joy to watch. He loves to run, bounce and bring out his inner pup. Belly rubs and ball games are right at the top of his list of favourite things.

 

Whilst he’s making great progress, Murray can still be wary of loud noises or fast movements — his “big boy pants” are on most of the time, but occasionally he needs a little reassurance.

 

This being the case, we feel Murray would be best suited to a calm, adult only home with people who have large breed experience. They will need to be understanding and patient allowing him to bond and grow his confidence at his own pace.

 

Murray would benefit from being enrolled onto obedience classes to help boost his confidence and support his transition into his new family life.

 

Murray could potentially live with a calm, neutered female resident dog who he can find confidence in and have as a companion. This will all be based on controlled introductions done here at the centre.

She’s looking for a calm home, with understanding people who will give her the time and patience she needs to settle. Frenchie would benefit from positive training classes to help boost her confidence, and she’d love to try a sighthound sport to keep her mind and body active once she has completely settled in.

 

Frenchie could potentially live with a neutered dog of similar size, depending on successful introductions here at the centre.

Frenchie has been buddied up with Brittany our resident spaniel. They have really taken to each ither and love to play on the garden zoom around.

Meet Sandy, Our Sweet Bulldog Lady. She is approximately 5 years old.

This beautiful girl is Sandy, a mature Bulldog who sadly found herself homeless. We’re not going to dwell on her past — Sandy is ready to look ahead to a life full of love, comfort, and adventures with her forever family.

When Sandy arrived, she was suffering from a sore, gunky eye caused by cherry eye. Our vet worked his magic, and now she’s looking (and feeling) so much better, with a brighter outlook on life.

Sandy is a gentle, happy-go-lucky soul. While she’s not the most athletic lady, she enjoys a couple of short walks during the day, and an evening stroll would be the perfect way to set her up for cosy cuddles on the sofa.

She has lovely doggy manners and has even made herself a best friend here — a handsome chap called Danny. Sandy strikes a perfect balance between love and play. She’s keen to learn new things and picks them up as quickly as a duck takes to water.

We think Sandy would benefit from joining some training classes to help her settle smoothly into her new home and maintain her wonderful manners. She could potentially live with respectful children, a neutered male dog of similar energy and size, and we’d also be happy to introduce her to resident cats.

As Sandy is a brachycephalic breed, her new family will need to have knowledge of the breed to ensure all her needs are met.

Say hello to our handsome Sheeba , a 8-9 month old mallinois x . Sheeba was brought into our care through unfortunate circumstances, he has not been treated very well and was extremely nervous of people as a result of this.

 

However, in the few weeks that Sheeba has been with us, his confidence has absolutely flourished! He is now a much more confident boy that loves his people. It’s clear that Sheeba has not had the socialisation or training that a puppy of his breed and age should have had by now… he can get very over excited when he sees other dogs and this comes out in barking and lunging. He has been working on his socialisation and manners around other dogs and is already showing great improvements .

 

Sadly, not long after Sheeba arrived he became very ill and had to be rushed to the emergency vets . Sheeba was unable to stand properly and had to have lots of tests carried out to find out what was wrong. It was found that Sheeba was suffering from an autoimmune problem. He has been on steroids since then and is back to his happy go Larry self ! Sheeba will continue to be on these meds and stay under the care of our vets until we feel that he is 100%.

 

Being a mallinois x , Sheeba has a lot of energy that will need to be fulfilled properly so that he can live a happy and enriched life. We are looking for owners that are experienced with the breed or similar so that he can have the best life possible . He could potentially live with cats depending on intros done at the centre. We are currently looking for a child and dog free home for him whilst he continues to work on his training, this is not to say that he can’t have doggie friends outside of the home.

Please welcome Gucci to the hotel. She is a 3 year old Pocket Bully who arrived in our care as a stray. On arrival she was very unsure of her surroundings and understandably fearful.
With time and patience Gucci started to relax, enjoying a fuss and tastey treats certainty helped her confidence grow.

As the days go by she is showing her beautiful personality and goofy nature.
Gucci absolutely loves a bum scratch, she would probably sit all day if this could be done.
She enjoys a good run in the garden and a rummage in the toy box.

Gucci will need an understanding home with humans who are happy to go with flow and not rush life.

Our behaviour team are working closely with Gucci on desensitisation to help her reamim relxed in the kennel environment and dog socialisation to build positive associations with canine friends.
At the moment Gucci would prefer a animal free home. This is to minimise her stress and maximise her potential by continuing her training plan and working on new skills as she develops.

Gucci has had a bath since being us, she settled in to it nicely and we very fond of the towel drying.

We always advise that new humans enrol their new companions on to training classes to help build bonds and adjust to thier new life.

Meet Manny – Our Handsome Collie Cross

Please welcome Manny to the hotel! This striking Collie cross is in his prime at around 6 years old. While we don’t know much about his past, we’d like to believe it held happy moments. Sadly, Manny currently lacks confidence and can become worried in certain situations, particularly around unfamiliar things and children.

The good news is that Manny communicates his feelings clearly, and he’s working closely with our behaviour team to build positive associations and grow his confidence. With the right support, he’s already making wonderful progress.

Once Manny knows and trusts you, he reveals his true nature — a loving, loyal companion who enjoys spending time with his humans. He loves long walks followed by fun games in the garden. Life in kennels is stressful for him, so we’re hoping the right person falls for him soon and can offer him the calm, understanding home he deserves.

Manny would be happiest in a quiet but active, adult-only home with owners who have Collie knowledge or experience. He’ll need time to settle in, ongoing training, and commitment to his rehabilitation. As an active Collie, he’ll require both physical and mental stimulation to keep him happy and fulfilled.

Training and obedience classes would be a great way to help Manny learn new skills and strengthen his bond with his new family. In time, as his confidence grows, we believe he would thrive in canine sports such as agility — giving him both a fun outlet and a confidence boost.

Manny could possibly live with a confident, neutered dog of similar energy levels, as well as dog-savvy cats, depending on careful introductions here at the centre.

Manny is ready for a fresh start with someone patient, kind, and willing to help him shine. Could that be you?

I need a quiet home, I need someone with breed experience, I would need my new owner to take me to training classes, I need some time to get to know new people

Introducing beautiful Miss Petal, an aproxinately 3 year old Bulldog who arrived in our care as an unclaimed stray however, she is now ready to find his forever home.

Unfortunately, Petal arrived into our care extremely over weight. She was also suffering from extremely sore and itchy skin on her face caused by a large face fold which was gathering bacteria and was restricting her breathing. She has recently had surgery to remove this fold, is recovering well and feeling much better in herself.

Petal is also now on a strict diet plan along with short but regular walks to help reduce her weight, as she struggles to walk for long periods. 

Despite this, she enjoys her walks and good roll on the floor. Petal  loves curling up into their laps for extra fusses in the garden after a walk. Fom her enthusiasm for walking, we are sure with time she will be a great adventure companion.

Petal can sometimes take time to trust new people and can be worried by touch however, once she warms up at her own pace, she loves nothing more than affection and attention.

Petal is the most precious and loving girl. All she cares for is love from her people and shows her appreciation with that Bulldog bum wiggle we all know and love .

This being the case, we feel Petal would be best suited to a quiet, adult only home with patient and understanding people who have good knowledge or experience of Bulldogs who will be committed to continue her weight loss plan and the daily upkeep and maintenance of her face folds and skin to ensure she’s kept happy and healthy.

Petal would benefit from being enrolled onto training classes to help teach her some basic skills and build a bond with her new owners.

She is currently working on her dog socialisation skills as she does like them however, can get very overaroused and barky. This will need to be continued by her new family using positive reward based methods.

Petal could potentially live with resident neutered dogs and dog savvy cats. This will all be based on controlled introductions here at the centre.

Please welcome our latest resident, Roxy!

Roxy has joined us after a change in her previous owner’s circumstances and is looking for her forever home. She is a Bulldog X and is around 2 years old.
She is a nervous girl who clearly hasn’t been exposed to the big wide world as much as she should have. Despite this, she shows a clear desire to explore and is gaining confidence, learning to trust staff and She has been working with the behaviour team on her doggy manners and skills and is looking for a home that can continue her training and provide her with plenty of walks and belly scratches!

Roxy will require a home with bulldog experience that will be committed to her daily upkeep and maintenance to keep her happy and healthy.

Depending on introductions Roxy would love an adult only home with out any visiting children. She can potentially live with neutered dogs of a similar size and cats.

Roxy has since had her surgery and is recovering well.

Roxy can sometimes lack confidence and needs time to decompress to touch.

Say hello to our beautiful Dobermann puppy girl , Scarlett! Scarl was brought into our care as a stray, after being found running round the streets worried and afraid. She is a very sweet girl that wants nothing more than affection from her humans and someone to adventure and play with. Scarlett is 9 months old.

Scarlett is looking for a home that are experienced with larger breeds. She would love a home that can take her on long adventures and bring her home for cuddles on the sofa. She loves a game of tug and fetch ! Scarlett is a little nervous on first meets , she can be wary of people at first but once she trusts you the love is never ending! She is working with our behaviour team and her confidence is growing daily.
Scarlett can struggle with meets with other dogs, we believe she has some barrier frustration towards them . She is currently being muzzle trained so that we can have proper introductions with other dogs and begin safe interactions and training. We believe with time and training Scarlett will be able to have some doggie pals again.

Scarlett is super affectionate and loves nothing more than fuss and love from her trusted people. She could potentially live with children 16+ that are dog savvy, she is not suitable to live with cats.

Introducing Xena, a beautiful 2-3 year old Dutch herder cross. We recently took on Xena from another kennels to give her a new chance at finding a forever home… could she be your new adventure dog?

Xena is a very loving and calm girl, she is social with people and likes to lean into her trusted pals for some love and fuss. Being a dutchie mix , Xena has an high drive and need to ‘work’. , her new owners will need to be familiar with this breed or similar . She will also need to take part in a working job or sports to keep her dutchie brain busy and fulfilled . She is housetrained and has previously lived in a home. Xena is a well balanced girl that would love to have a ‘job’ and end the day with her humans at home for a cuddle and play.

She absolutely loves a game of tug (but you have to be strong to play with her!) and is food & toy driven so is the perfect contender for training sessions. Xena does however chase/react to traffic quite badly, she is working with our behaviour team on this and can be easily redirected onto a toy so is showing good potential. She does love her walks, just when there is peace and quiet of no traffic around. She would love to live somewhere out of the city with owners that can continue to work on her traffic reactivity with her.

Depending on introductions done at the centre Xena could possibly live with;
– [ ] Dogs
– [ ] Cats
– [ ] Children 16+ that are dog savvy

Please say a gentle hello to Helga , who is a 5 year old French bulldog. On arrival at the centre our Helga was very confused. wouldn’t you be if you where being dumped by the person who was meant to keep you safe? Unfortunately Helga is another fake stray who has been disregarded.

However once she found a friend she could trust she slowly came out her shell and became more relaxed with her surroundings.

She has been going on mini adventures with her new friends and exploring a little further each time. She seems to have a good lead manners and is none reactive to traffic or cyclists.

Helga is a little vocal passing other dogs,  we will hopefully work on making some canine friends while she at the centre and she will be able to continue her training plan in her new home and enrol on to training classes to help prepare further.

Once helga is comfortable with you she likes to jump around for a fuss. She is working on calm skills and has learnt to relax for a chin and stomach fuss with out all the excitement. Obviously treats are involved with her training so helga is up for a challenge when food is around.

Helga loves a good zoomie and playing with toys (again once she is comfortable and settled)
Her confidence is growing daily, she can still get spooked if you move too fast or if she hears loud noises. Reassuring her seems to help her relax quickly and she soon forgets.

Helga is looking for a quiet home, it would not be fair to place her in a busy house hold as she would not cope with the hussel and bustle .

If you are looking for a cuddle companion who needs time to adjust and someone who up for a good walk a couple of times a day then please consider Helga. She can’t wait to meet you.

Helga needs and adult only pet free home,
Helga will require upkeep to her face folds and bottom area to avoid bacteria build up.

 

Helga has been placed in foster to help her progress further with her training. She is the perfect house guest, love to sit on laps, learning how to settle and take time out.

This is Gomez, a cane corso that was recently brought back into our care through no fault of his own. Gomez is a beautiful boy with a lovely personality , he is around 1 year old.

Gomez has such a sweet but worried soul, he finds the world around him a little too overwhelming. However he does still love  his daily walks with our volunteers and definitely has his favourites! Gomez will be a great companion for someone that loves hikes or long walks in the countryside or up mountains. He also absolutely loves his time that he gets to spend in our sensory garden, and will show you his happiness with lots of lanky legged zoomies and play bows. He enjoys playing with his toys and is partial to a treat or two.

Gomez Can be worried upon first meets and takes some time to warm up to people. His confidence is growing every day that he has been with us and he has been working with our behaviour team to build up his confidence and slow down his worries . Gomez has all the love in the world to give you once he trusts you, he loves snuggling up to his people and will give you his paw when he wants more scratches .

He can be worried about other dogs however we believe this is not the fact that he doesn’t like them, he just has never had proper introductions with them so is uncertain and he shows this with barking. We are working on this with him and he is improving , we are hoping that Gomez will eventually have some canine pals of his own. He is a strong boy that will need a calm and confident handler that is familiar with the mastiff breed. Gomez is  only young and very bright, he is taking to training very well and his new owners will need to take him to training classes to keep up with this.

We all have a soft spot for this fabulous lad and hope that we can land him in his perfect forever home . He is looking for a calm adult only home with no other pets so he can have owners that can focus all the attention on him and work with him to make him a happier and more confident boy. Could you be the one for him?

Please welcome back to the hotel, our gorgeous Holly. Holly has been returned into our care through no fault of her own. After spending some time settling back in she is now looking for her forever sofa. Holly is around 7-8 years old.

Holly is a wonderful girl that is definitely a fan favourite amongst our volunteers. She has a zest for life ( and anything involving tennis balls!) Holly enjoys long walks down the river and will absolutely take a dip no matter the weather. She would be the perfect adventure pal for a human that enjoys hiking and swimming! She is a very people-orientated dog that loves butt scratches and fusses from her trusted humans. When holly sees you, she will bring you her favourite tennis ball to show that she is happy to see you! Holly would love to take up some training classes to keep her shepherd brain busy and fulfilled and will take to this with no issues as she is very motivated!

Holly has been described to be ‘a joy to walk’ , she can however be strong on the lead and will need some work to brush up on her loose leash walking skills. Holly passes other calm dogs fine on walks, she can struggle when they react to her and she is showing much improvement on ignoring them and passing on. Holly is not the biggest fan of doggies in her personal space, she is much more adapted to human pals. We are sure with her new owners carrying on the necessary reward based training classes , she will be able to overcome these worries as she is showing improvement already .

Holly is looking for an adult only , pet free home to live the best life she can.

Introducing local handsome heart stealer, Dart the lurcher!

Don’t let this lads long legs fool you, he is a young boy at only 21 months. Dart is now looking for his forever home where he can have zoomies and naps on the sofa until his hearts content.

Dart has a lovely nature, he is a gentle boy that enjoys having fusses from his humans and long walks before chilling out for the rest of the day. He is very bright and a quick learner, his new owners will need to take him to training classes to help tidy up some general skills but this should be no problem as he loves his treats!

Dart gets the best zoomies , which are sure to put a smile on any lurcher lovers face.

Dart was brought back into our care after he was with us as a puppy, unfortunately he was reported to have shown some resource guarding issues. Dart has been working on this with our behaviour team since he arrived and we have seen massive improvements with this. He is coming on such a long way and his new owners will just need to continue with management and training to help him along with this.

Depending on introductions done at the centre dart could possibly live with another neutered resident dog of a similar nature. Dart is best suited to a child and feline free home.

She is a little shy and overwhelmed at the moment, and is in need of gentle love and kindness to help her feel safe as she begins to come out of her shell.

Snowy is a very gentle and sweet soul who will be looking for a calm and quiet home where she can settle at her own pace. She will need at least one other kind and confident resident dog in her new home to be her friend and to help guide her as she adjusts to her new life.

As Snowy has never lived in a home before, her adopters will need to help her learn all about home life and new skills such as house training and how to walk on a lead.

With patience, understanding and the company of a canine friend, Snowy will blossom into the most wonderful companion.

She is a little shy at the moment, so she will need a kind resident dog in her new home to help her settle and show her the ropes. With the support of another dog, she will quickly find her paws.

Winnie is very easy to handle and has a gentle nature. She isn’t scared, just unsure of all the new things she’s experiencing, and once she gains some confidence she will start to enjoy human attention and all the comforts of home. She already walks nicely on a lead when another dog is walking alongside her, and with time she will learn to do this on her own.

Like many dogs who haven’t lived in a home before, Winnie will need to learn about house training, but she is a bright little girl and we don’t think it will take her long to pick this up. With patience, reassurance, and lots of love, Winnie will soon blossom into a wonderful companion who deserves the happy life ahead of her.

He also enjoys snuggling up with his friends in the kennels, therefore, we believe he would be much more confident when he has a kind resident dog around to help guide him and show him the ropes.

As Kiwi has never lived in a home before, everything will be very new to him. He will need patient, gentle guidance to learn the basics of home life at his own pace, including house training, walking on a lead, and discovering the everyday sights and sounds of family life. He is a sensitive little boy who will flourish in a calm, loving environment, and with time and encouragement, he will thrive and gain confidence every day.

We feel Kiwi could also live with older, dog-savvy children who understand that he may need time to settle and who will enjoy helping him explore and grow. Once he has settled into home life, Kiwi will love being included in family life, enjoying cuddles, quiet moments, and the chance to explore the world at his own pace.

She is not overly confident just yet, so she will need to be homed with a kind resident dog who can help show her the ropes and doesn’t mind a playful puppy bouncing around the house.

We feel Koi could also live with dog-savvy children who will understand her needs, give her space to settle, and enjoy helping her learn and grow.

Her adopters must agree to have her spayed when she is old enough and to take her to puppy socialisation classes, which will help her build confidence and grow into a well-rounded adult dog. Once she has settled into home life, Koi will love going on plenty of adventures with her new family, and she will thrive on being included in all aspects of family life.

Udon hasn’t had much socialisation in her life so far, and as a result, she is quite worried about being handled at the moment. When approached, she will gently back herself into a corner, but she can then be easily picked up without any fuss.

Despite her worries, Udon is a very sweet girl who just needs time, patience, and kindness to help her learn that people can be kind. She will be looking for a calm and quiet home where there is already a kind and confident resident dog who can take her under their wing and help her settle into her new life, but this dog would need to be larger than her.

As she has never lived in a home before, everything will be completely new to her. Her adopters will need to be understanding as she learns all about home life and new skills like house training and how to walk on a lead.

With the guidance of a friendly dog and lots of gentle encouragement, Udon will start to come out of her shell and truly blossom. If you feel you can offer this special girl the patient and supportive home she needs, please don't leave her waiting.",09/15/2025

When she first arrived, Tayto was unsure of everything – the new sights, smells and sounds were all so different from the life she had known, and she needed time to take it all in.

Now that she has been with us for a month, Tayto has made some lovely progress. She has settled into her routine and is beginning to show her sweet, playful side. Tayto loves running around the yard with her friends, chasing toys and enjoying the sunshine. She greets her carer with a waggy tail, happily approaches for kisses, and will even hop onto a lap to take treats – something that seemed impossible just a few short weeks ago. She still gets a little worried if approached too quickly, but she is learning that people can be kind and gentle.

Tayto will need a calm, quiet, and understanding home with patient adopters who will give her all the time she needs to feel safe. She must have at least one kind and confident resident dog who will be her friend and guide as she learns about life in a loving home. Tayto has never lived in a house before, so she will need help with house training, learning to walk on a lead, and getting used to all the new experiences that will come her way.

With time, love and gentle reassurance, Tayto will flourish. She is a very sweet girl who deserves the chance to feel safe, cherished and part of a family for the very first time in her life.",09/15/2025

This darling girl is in desperate need of some TLC and kindness, as she has not known much love or comfort in her life so far. Despite this, she has the gentlest of natures and is already showing us what a super sweet soul she is.

Erin is good with other dogs and finds comfort in their company, so she will need to go to a home where there is at least one kind, confident resident dog who can help guide her and show her the ropes of home life. She looks to other dogs for reassurance and will lean on them while she learns about all the new sights, sounds, and experiences of the big wide world.

As Erin has never lived in a home before, everything will be new to her. She will need to learn all about house training, walking on a lead, and the daily routines that most dogs take for granted. This will take time, patience, and gentle encouragement from her adopters. She will thrive in a calm, understanding adult home where she is given the space to grow in confidence at her own pace.

What Erin needs most is a loving family who will wrap her up in the care she has missed out on and help her discover just how wonderful life can be. With time and love, this special girl will blossom into the loyal, devoted companion we know she has the potential to be. She truly deserves her happy ever after.

She has had a big change in her little life, but she is already showing us what a happy and gentle soul she is.

Wincy is an easy-going girl who could possibly be an only dog in the right home, but she does enjoy the company of her canine friends. She would be very happy to share her new life with another dog who is kind, playful, and will help show her the ropes. She is such a sweet natured girl and can live with dog-savvy kids who allow her time to settle in.

Although she can be a little shy when you first meet her, it doesn’t take long before her tail is wagging and she comes over to ask for a fuss. She is easy to handle, loves a cuddle, and rewards you with plenty of kisses. Wincy also has a fun, playful side, she adores toys and loves to carry them proudly in her mouth to show them off as she runs around.

As Wincy hasn’t lived in a home before, she will need patient adopters who can help her learn all the basics, including house training and walking on a lead.

Reggie,/media/animal_images/Reggie-06-09-25f.jpeg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/4778/,4 years,Male,Maltese,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Please meet the most special little boy.. Reggie! Reggie has come to us from a home and does have some behavioral issues which mean that he will be looking for a very specific, experienced, adult only home. Please don’t let that put you off though, because in the right home he is going to truly thrive and become your best friend! He is so loving and a joy to spend time with.

Reggie is a total heartbreaker. He’s only 4 years old and has so far been in 3 homes. In his first home, he was very fearful of being groomed. We are told that this resulted in his owners having to pin him down every time they needed to groom him or clip his nails. As you can imagine, this was quite traumatising for Reggie and so he learned a growl, a nip or a bite would get the scary hands to go away. Over the course of 4 years his fears got worse and this has left him not tolerating his head being touched at all.

Reggie’s owners were unable to cope and so he was booked in to be put to sleep, but thankfully a kind family stepped in and rescued him. Unfortunately with a baby on the way they were unable to keep him and so after 2 weeks in his new home he came to Many Tears. He was very briefly adopted, but sadly the adopters felt he wasn’t the right match and so he was returned to Many Tears. He is now in a foster home and doing incredibly well, but it’s vital that his next home is his forever home.

He is looking for an adult only home with adopters who have experience with dogs with similar issues and will be committed to working on them with him and will never give up on him. Reggie's challenges are mostly around grooming, nail trims, and having certain areas of his head and tail touched. He is also very sensitive about having collars and harnesses taken off and this does need to be done with care and positive reinforcement.

Despite his quirks, he is an extremely loving boy. All he wants is to be with you, next to you and on top of you. If you’re on the sofa, he’d like to be on your lap, having a snooze. If you’re not paying him any attention, then he will dance around you asking for fuss! He LOVES to be stroked as long as it’s on his body. He will happily let you stroke his back, sides and chest all day long and will wag his little tail non stop. If you move above his collar, he will duck his head away from you or give a warning growl. He is very easy to be around as long as you are respectful of him.

Reggie can show some signs of resource guarding, particularly with very small Reggie sized toys and so his adopters will need to be willing to work on this with him too. He will swap out a toy for a treat and just needs some help to realise he doesn't need to worry about having things taken away from him.

That said, being a Maltese, he is going to require brushing, grooming, nail clipping and of course handling during vet visits. We have started doing short training sessions with him where we let our fingers lightly graze his head as he’s offered a tasty treat or chicken. His behavior won’t change overnight, but with kindness, love and consistency he will make great improvements. His adopters would need to continue working with him daily and be aware that this might be a long process, but it will be so worth it in the long run. His adopters will need to work with an experienced groomer who will be empathetic to his needs or would need to be willing to have him groomed by the vets under sedation.

Reggie is a delight to have around, he has been completely clean in the house and sleeps without a peep (...well unless you count his warthog style snoring!) He is confident enough that he could be homed as an only dog, but he is in foster with two small dogs and so could be homed with another kind dog. He is in foster with a cat, but he does bark and chase her, so would be best suited to a cat free home.

Reggie LOVES to go for walks and walks incredibly well on the lead. He is very sensitive about having his harness and collar put on, but with tasty treats and a step in harness he has been fine.

In the right home and with the right family he will make the most incredible little companion. All he needs is love, kindness, patience and a family who will accept him and love him as he is. Underneath his fear, he is the sweetest little boy and after all he has been through, that’s the very minimum he deserves.",09/15/2025

At the moment, she is feeling very overwhelmed by her new surroundings and is incredibly frightened of human touch. She is a gentle girl, but her fear runs deep, and she will currently panic if approached or handled.

Jinny will need an experienced, adult only home. She will need adopters who have experience with scared ex-breeding dogs and can offer her the time, space, and understanding she so desperately needs. Her adopters must be patient and kind, allowing Jinny to go at her own pace as she slowly begins to trust and adjust to a world that is completely new to her.

She will need at least one kind and confident resident dog in her new home to take her under their wing. A calm canine companion will be essential in helping Jinny learn that human hands can be gentle and kind, and that life can be safe and full of love. She will watch and learn from another dog, and their presence will give her confidence and comfort.

Jinny has never lived in a home before, so everything from the sound of a washing machine to the sight of a TV will be new to her. She will need help with house training and lots of gentle encouragement as she learns about home life. Walking on a lead will be far too overwhelming for her at this stage, so she will need to practice in a secure garden until she is ready to venture further.

Her journey will not be a quick or easy one, but it will be worth it. In time, with love and patience, Jinny will begin to bloom, and the bond you form with her will be something truly special.

If you have a quiet home, a kind resident dog, and the heart to help a very scared girl find her way, please consider offering Jinny the safe haven she has always deserved.

At the moment her lip folds require regular cleaning.

Hasty can be quite nervous when she is away from her kennel friends, often shutting down until she feels safe and reassured. She really comes to life when she is around them and will need a kind and confident resident dog in her new home to help guide her and give her confidence as she learns about life in a family.

As she has never lived in a home before, she will need patient guidance to learn the basics of home life, including house training and walking on a lead. A secure garden to start will help her explore safely and build confidence at her own pace.

Once Hasty has settled and feels safe, she would love an active home where she can enjoy adventures, play, and be part of family life. She will thrive in a calm, understanding household that will give her the time, patience, and love she needs to blossom.

When she first arrived, she was a very overwhelmed and nervous little girl who relied heavily on the company of other dogs for comfort. She wasn’t quite brave enough to approach on her own, but once in gentle hands, she showed what a sweet and loving soul she truly is.

Since then, Raisin has really flourished in our care. She was lucky enough to spend some time in a foster home where she experienced the comfort of family life for the very first time. Sadly, she had to return to the rescue after showing some dominant behaviour with another female dog in the home. However, these behaviours have not been seen in kennels either before or since, and she is currently happily sharing her space with three female cocker spaniel–sized dogs. She eats alongside them under the supervision of her kennel mum and has not shown any guarding behaviours. With the right environment, we feel confident Raisin will continue to blossom. However, because Raisin has displayed these behaviours in the home, she will need an adult-only household that can continue to provide her with the structure and love she desperately craves.

Raisin will need a calm and understanding home where she can feel safe and secure. She would do best with adopters who can provide patience, reassurance, and the time she needs to settle. She will need a kind resident dog in the home of similar size or bigger that is laid back, and doesn't mind sharing their space.

Her new family will need to guide her gently through the basics of home life, including house training and walking on a lead. Starting with gentle introductions in the garden will help her build confidence. Raisin has also had several teeth removed at the time of her spay. Our vet has noted she has Horner’s Syndrome, which causes some drooping around her eyes, and Grade 2 luxating patellas on her right hind limb. With gentle exercise and muscle building, this may improve, but it may also need further monitoring by her new vet. Potential adopters should be aware this would not be covered by insurance.

Raisin has already come such a long way and has so much love to give. With kindness, time, and patience, she will blossom into the most wonderful companion. She is such a sweet girl who is more than ready for a forever home of her own.",09/15/2025

Koala loves his kennel friends and relies on them for comfort, so at the moment we are looking for a home where there is a kind resident dog who can help show him the ropes.

Koala adores being held and fussed over, and he would love a home where he can go on plenty of adventures with his new family but also curl up on the sofa at the end of the day for a cuddle.

As he has never lived in a home before, everything will be new to him. His adopters will need to gently guide him through the basics of home life, including house training and learning how to walk on a lead. Puppy socialisation classes will also be very important to help him build confidence and grow into a well-rounded adult dog.

We feel Koala could live with older, dog-savvy children who will understand that he may need time to settle and who will enjoy helping him learn.

When he arrived he was a very scared little boy, who was feeling very overwhelmed. He is slowly starting to settle in and now has moved to a foster home to continue the next steps in his journey. It’s clear he has not had much socialisation before, and he doesn’t yet realise that human hands can be kind and loving, but he will now come forward and lick his fosterers fingers, which is a great first step.

Douglas will need a calm and quiet, adult-only home with adopters who have experience with very scared ex-breeding dogs and the patience to help him settle in at his own pace. He must have at least one other kind and confident resident dog in his new home who can take him under their wing and show him that life can be safe and happy.

Before moving to foster, he had never lived in a home before so his adopters will need to be kind and understanding as he settles in and learns all about home life and new skills like house training. He is settling in well to home life in his foster home and has enjoyed exploring the garden and will now curl up in a soft bed close to his fosterer.

He has never walked on a lead or harness before and so will need to practice in a secure garden until he gains the confidence to go further.

With time, love, and gentle care, Douglas will begin to feel safe and we are sure he will blossom into the much-loved companion he was always meant to be.

Disco has some tiny lumps which our vet will assess.

Disco will need a calm and quiet adult-only home with at least one kind resident dog to be her friend and help her settle into her new life. She relies on her kennel friend and would like a home with at least one other dog who will allow her to cuddle up to them if she wants to.

Disco has never lived in a home before, so this will be quite scary at first as she learns about home life and new skills like house training and how to walk on a lead. These are things that may take her a while to pick up, as the garden may be just as scary as the house at first.

When she first came to us from a breeder, life outside of kennels was completely overwhelming. Every sight, sound, and touch was new and sometimes frightening, and Chequers understandably found all the sudden changes a lot to cope with. At that time, she needed a calm, adult-only home with a confident resident dog to help her learn that the world, and the humans in it, could be safe, kind, and full of love.

Since then, Chequers has shown us just how much potential she has to shine. She has grown into such a happy, content girl, greeting her carers with wiggles of joy and nudging for fuss and attention. Walks are now something she enjoys, trotting along nicely in her harness, though her nose sometimes gets the better of her if there’s a really good scent to follow!

Her playful personality has also started to sparkle. She enjoys meeting new canine friends, big and small, and while she’ll happily have a little runabout, she’s just as likely to flop down for a good roll in the sand (especially right after being groomed!). Speaking of grooming, Chequers is a dream, she’ll sit beautifully to be brushed and takes it all in her stride, a far cry from the nervous girl who once flinched at every movement. While she can still be startled if things move too quickly, gentle handling and reassurance help her continue to grow in confidence.

We feel Chequers would thrive in a home with another dog who can guide her as she keeps learning the ropes of family life. She could also live with older, dog-savvy children who understand that sometimes she might need a little space. She has met a cat at the rescue well and so could potentially be homed with a dog savvy cat in the right circumstances.

Chequers’ journey so far is a testament to her resilience and sweet nature. With the right family, patient, kind, and ready to give her the time she needs, she will continue to flourish. Watching her transform from a shy, uncertain girl into a joyful companion has already been so rewarding, and the best is yet to come.

Haven will need a gentle resident dog in her new home to help guide her and show her all the wonderful things that come with living as part of a family. She has lots still to learn, from house training to walking nicely on a lead, so her new owners will need to be patient as she takes these steps at her own pace. Gentle introductions to the outside world, along with time and encouragement, will help her flourish.

This sweet girl is so ready to begin her forever journey. With love, patience, and guidance, Haven will blossom into a happy, loyal, and joyful companion, bringing light and laughter to the lucky home that welcomes her.

Haven has come to us with a small lump on the left side of her body which will be assessed at the time of her spay. She is also showing signs of a luxating patella on her right side.

This sweet girl will need a kind resident dog in her new home, a steady presence she can rely on for comfort and reassurance and an adult-only household where she can settle at her own pace, free from pressure.

Daisy Dee has never lived in a home, so she will need adopters who are patient and understanding as she learns the basics: walking on a lead, house training, and discovering what it feels like to be safe and loved. Although, some garden sniffs may be a good start before taking on big explorations. Behind her timid exterior is a little lady full of warmth and sweetness, quietly waiting for someone to see her heart.

All Daisy Dee asks for is a chance, a special family who will take the time to help her bloom and finally give her the love and security she has always deserved.

She has come to us with a small pea sized lump which will be assessed at the time of her spay, and is a little on the overweight side so she will benefit from exercise and a healthy diet.

Eleven is a 4-year-old Pomsky who has come to us from a breeder and is now ready to find a kind and understanding forever home. Though she had a shy start to life, this beautiful girl has truly blossomed since arriving at the rescue. What was once a wary, shut-down little dog has now become a tail-wagging bundle of affection, ready to give kisses and cuddles to those she trusts.

Eleven has never lived in a home before, so she will need patient adopters who can help her learn all about house training, household noises, and the comforting routines of home life. She doesn’t yet walk on a lead, but with time, encouragement, and a secure garden to enjoy, we’re confident she’ll come to love her little adventures.

Originally very reliant on her kennel friends, Eleven has grown in confidence and now shows a real draw to people. Because of this, she would like a home with a kind resident dog and lots of companionship and affection from her humans.

This sweet and gentle girl needs a calm and loving environment where she’ll be given the time and reassurance to continue building her confidence. In return, she’ll shower you with loyalty, affection, and a truly special kind of love.

If you’re looking for a devoted friend who’s ready to begin her new life, Eleven might just be the one to complete your home.",09/15/2025
Earth,/media/animal_images/Earth-06-09-25a.jpeg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/2296/,1 year,Female,Pomsky,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Earth is a beautiful little princess who has come to us from a breeder and is now ready to begin the next chapter of her life. When she first arrived, she was curious about people but didn’t quite have the courage to approach. There was always a sweetness in her waiting to shine, and with time and patience, it’s now beginning to blossom.

Earth has made incredible progress since her arrival. She now happily trots over to greet you, showers your hands with kisses, and rolls onto her back for her very favorite thing in the world, a belly rub! She is still gaining confidence, but her affectionate and playful nature is shining through more and more each day.

Because Earth finds comfort in the company of other dogs, she will need a kind and confident resident dog in her new home to help guide her as she continues to learn. She has never lived in a home before, so she will need patient adopters who can gently help her with house training and getting used to everyday life. She is starting to enjoy new experiences and will love exploring in a secure garden once she feels safe.

We now feel Earth could also live with older, gentle children who understand that she may need time and space to settle at her own pace.

Earth has already shown us just how far she has come, and in the right home she will truly blossom. She is such a loving, gentle girl who is more than ready to become a cherished member of a family.",09/15/2025
Oceana,/media/animal_images/Ocean-12-09-25b.jpg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.png,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/3977/,10 years,Female,Mastiff Cross,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Oceana is one of several dogs rescued from a home in heartbreaking conditions. Their elderly owner, struggling with mental health issues, was overwhelmed, and the home had become dirty and unmanageable. Though not intentionally mistreated, the dogs went without proper care. Now safe with us, they're finally experiencing love and stability.

According to her microchip, she's a Mastiff cross Cambrian Shepherd, the latter being a mix of Welsh Sheepdog and Pyrenean Mountain Dog. There may be a few other breeds in the mix too, but one thing’s certain: she’s a beautiful, big girl.

Oceana is your typical senior girl. She is gentle, calm and happiest when she's curled up snoozing in her bed. She is ready to find her perfect retirement home, where she can enjoy a slower pace of life and receive all the love and kindness she desires and deserves.

When Oceana arrived, she was quite shy but she has since started to come out of her shell and blossom into the loveliest lady. Oceana has always lived alongside other dogs and would be happy to share her home with another dog who was a calm, respectful companion who shares her laid-back energy and doesn’t intrude on her space. However, she would be perfectly content to be homed as an only dog in the right circumstances as long as her adopters were around most of the time.

Oceana has now learned to walk on a lead and is doing so well. She enjoys going for gentle strolls and likes to have a little sniff around the yard and a toilet break before heading back to her bed for another nap.

Oceana's adopters will need to be kind and understanding as she settles in to her new home as she will need to learn all about home life as well as new skills like house training.

She arrived here in quite poor condition, as you can see from her photos. Her ears were very badly infected and she had quite sore skin but with lots of love, TLC and visits to our vet she is starting to feel much better. She also has what is likely the start of cataracts in her eyes as well as some lumps and bumps. She is very underweight and so is being fed little and often to ensure she gets all the nutrients she needs and starts to gain some weight.

What Oceana needs now is peace, patience, and plenty of love. She deserves to be snuggled up in the warmest, softest spots in the home, surrounded by gentle voices and kind hands. With the right family, she will blossom and finally get to live the life she has always deserved.",09/15/2025

At the moment, Sally finds comfort snuggled up with her kennel friends and is frightened of human interaction. She doesn’t yet understand that hands can be kind, but we’re gently helping her learn that she is safe and loved.

She’s never known life in a home, so everything will be very new for her but we believe there’s a special someone out there who will help her shine.

Sally is looking for a calm, adult only home with at least one resident dog who can offer her comfort, companionship and show her the ropes. She will watch what they do and then start to copy them once she gains some confidence. Her new family will need to be experienced, patient, and prepared to take things slowly. House training, learning to walk on a lead and getting used to home life will all take time but she will get there at her own pace.

Sally’s adopters must have a secure garden as even being outside may feel overwhelming at first but with each small step she’ll build her confidence and it will be the most rewarding journey to be a part of.

We know Sally has a long way to go, but she deserves a chance. In the right home, with love, patience, and gentle guidance, she will blossom into the happy girl she was always meant to be.

Sally has been treated for a ear infection in both ears, but they are now looking much better. Our vets have also noted that her third eyelid is slightly projecting in one eye, but no action is needed for this.

She is a super sweet girl who already loves a cuddle, though she can still be a little nervous at times. With kindness, patience, and the right environment, we know this lovely lady will soon blossom into the most wonderful companion.

Like so many of our dogs, Happy has never lived in a home before, so everything will be new to her. She will need gentle guidance as she learns about house training, lead walking, and all the routines of family life. A kind resident dog will be essential in her new home, as she finds great comfort in the company of other dogs and will look to them for reassurance as she grows in confidence.

Happy is such a tender-hearted girl who has already shown us how much she wants to trust and love. With time and TLC, she will flourish and bring endless joy to the special family who gives her the chance she so deserves.

Happy has come to us with some alopecia on her back, that should go away with comforts of a home. Her tail seems to have previously been docked and she is missing some toes. But none of this seems to slow her down!

Hasty,/media/animal_images/hasty1_ZofIKSv.png.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.png,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/1698/,5 years,Female,Dachshund,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Hasty is a truly precious little soul who has lived her life on the sidelines and is now searching for a home as gentle and understanding as she is. Coming from a heartbreaking background, Hasty has sadly missed out on the kindness of human hands, and even now, she finds people very frightening. When she first arrived, she would urinate in fear when handled and try anything to avoid being touched and while she has made small steps in foster care, she remains very much a work in progress.

Hasty spends most of her time in her open crate where she feels safest. Before discovering the comfort of her crate, she would destroy beds and soft furnishings through sheer stress, but now she snuggles happily in her den. She potters around the house and garden, and will hop up onto the sofa alongside the other dogs, always keeping one wary eye on nearby humans. If we approach too quickly, she hurries away but will bravely return to be close by once she feels the coast is clear.

Her biggest comfort in life is other kind, confident dogs. She relies heavily on them for guidance, reassurance and company. She has formed a special bond with foster dog Twist, who looks after her and curls up beside her at bedtime. For this reason, Hasty must have a calm resident dog or two in her new home.

Hasty is not going to be a lapdog or a cuddle companion. She is still very fearful of being caught or handled, and sometimes has to be gently swaddled in a blanket in order to be lifted for care. Once in arms she freezes, allowing soft kisses and strokes, but she remains rigid and desperate to escape. For her, bravery looks like just staying near you, not running away, and we celebrate each tiny milestone.

That said, Hasty has a cheeky and endearing side, especially when food is involved! She comes alive at mealtimes and loves her treats (tube cheese is her favourite!). She barks excitedly and pulls at foster mum’s trouser legs to hurry things along, then darts to her crate to gobble up her food with gusto.

Hasty is a painfully sad reminder of how cruel the puppy farming trade can be but we haven’t given up on her, and we know there is someone very special out there who won’t give up on her either. She will need:

An experienced, adult-only home
At least one kind, confident resident dog
A safe-zone crate where she can retreat
A commitment to patience, consistency, and zero pressure

Hasty doesn’t want much, just warm beds, good food, loving canine company and a gentle human who will let her learn what love is, in her own time. The bond she builds won’t be flashy or instant… but it will be deep, pure and, once forged, unbreakable.",09/15/2025

She is a sweet but timid little girl who is currently feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the changes in her life. Despite this, she is already showing us what a lovely soul she is, and with time, love, and patience we don’t think it will take her long to come out of her shell and blossom into the most wonderful girl.

Lucky will be looking for a calm and quiet home, where she can settle in at her own pace and would need at least one other kind and confident resident dog in her new home to be her friend.

As she has never lived in a home before, Lucky will need kind and understanding adopters as she will need to learn all about home life and new skills like house training. She has begun learning to walk on a lead and harness, and with gentle encouragement she will continue to grow in confidence.

She has an inguinal hernia, which will be repaired at the time of her spay.

She is a sweet little girl who is a bit shy at the moment, but she is doing her very best to be brave. With gentle love and patience, we know she will continue to blossom. Lilo already seems to enjoy cuddles and we think, once settled, she will absolutely love being someone’s much-loved and very special girl.

She will be looking for a calm and quiet home, and would like there to be at least one other kind and confident resident dog to be her friend and guide.

As she has never lived in a home before, Lilo will need to learn all about house training and everything that goes with home life. She will also need to learn all about walking on a lead and harness and would need to practice in a secure garden before venturing further when she has gained more confidence.

She’s an inquisitive little soul who adores a good head tickle and is already showing us her gentle, affectionate side.

Right now, Delly is feeling a little less brave in this new environment and is drawing comfort from the company of her kennel friends. Because of this, we feel it would be best for Delly to be rehomed with another dog who can offer her reassurance, guidance, and companionship. That said, we’ll continue to assess her confidence while she’s with us, as it’s possible that, with time, she could adapt to being an only dog if her new family had plenty of time and love to give her.

As Delly has never lived in a home before, she will need to learn all about house training, lead training, and the many basics of home life. With kindness, patience, and the help of a canine friend, we’re confident she’ll pick things up in no time.

Delly truly is a loving little girl with so much potential, and in the right home, she will blossom into a loyal, joyful, and cherished companion.

When Haisley arrived with us, she absolutely broke our hearts. She was just so worried and overwhelmed and was completely shut down. She would sit in a corner shaking when you would approach her and was just a very sad girl.

Fast forward and couple of weeks and sweet little Haisley has made SO much progress. She's still a very worried girl, but you will now find her sitting at the front of her kennel playing with toys instead of hiding away like she used to do. She has also discovered the joy of the play yard and will now run around with her canine pals having fun! She is still very worried about humans but has made so much progress in trusting and will not approach and sit near you if she knows you - showing fantastic progress.

Haisley will be looking for a calm and quiet, adult only home where there was at least one other gentle and kind resident dog to help her build confidence and show her the way as she has never lived in a home before. Her adopters will need to be kind and understanding as she settles in and learns all about new skills like house training. She has never walked on a lead before and so will need to practice first around the home and garden until she is confident enough to venture into the outside world.

Haisley is definitely a project dog and it’s going to take a lot of time and work to get her anywhere close to being a ‘normal’ dog, but it will be so rewarding to see her reach new milestones and make progress.

He is a gentle, sweet-natured boy with a wonderfully laid-back temperament. Each day, Lemon is blossoming in confidence, and we can already see what a special companion he is going to be. He loves nothing more than climbing onto a kind lap for cuddles and fuss and so we think he is going to adore being someones special boy.

He loves his kennel friends and so for this reason, Lemon is looking for a home with another kind resident dog who can help show him the ropes and be his companion. We would consider homing him with kind and gentle, dog savvy teenagers.

Lemon has never lived in a home before, so his adopters will need to be patient and understanding as he settles into home life and learns new skills like house training. He has begun learning to walk on a lead and harness and he’s doing well but will need some more practice and gentle encouragement to grow in confidence.

Our vets have noted that he has a cataract in his left eye and is starting to develop a cataract in his right eye. These don't seem to impair his vision currently but will need to be monitored by his adopter and their vet going forward.

Hope is a sweet and gentle soul who can be a little timid and unsure around human attention. She prefers to observe quietly at first and will need plenty of patience, TLC, and time to gain confidence.

As she has never lived in a home before, Hope will need gentle guidance to learn all the basics of home life, including house training and walking on a lead. She will thrive in a calm and loving environment where she can settle at her own pace and feel safe exploring the world around her. Hope will also need a kind and confident resident dog in the home to help guide her, give her reassurance, and show her how to feel comfortable in a family setting.

He has come to us from a breeder, and it is utterly heartbreaking to see just how overwhelmed and shut down he feels. Life has not been kind to him so far, and the sadness in his eyes tells us how desperately he needs someone patient and gentle to help him find his way.

Right now, Beethoven struggles to find the courage to face people on his own. He takes comfort in the company of other dogs and leans on them to feel safe. For this reason, he will need a kind and confident resident dog in his new home, someone to guide him, to show him that he can trust, and that the hands reaching out to him are only ever filled with love.

He will be looking for a calm and quiet, adult only home where he can settle in at his own pace. He would be best suited to a home with adopters who have experience of scared rescue dogs.

Beethoven has never known the warmth of living in a home before, so everything will be new and strange to him. Simple things like housetraining, learning to walk on a lead, or even settling indoors will all take time, understanding, and patience. A secure garden will be a safe haven for him at first, where quiet sniffs and tiny moments of bravery will slowly begin to build his confidence.

Although he is so very frightened right now, Beethoven is still only a young lad, with his whole life ahead of him, a life he has never yet had the chance to truly live. All he needs is someone willing to take that chance on him, to offer him kindness, consistency, and love. With the right family and the support of a canine friend, Beethoven will one day learn that he doesn’t have to be afraid anymore.

She loves being active, enjoying fuss and attention, and has a wonderful, easy-going nature. While she is full of confidence, she still enjoys the company of other dogs, so we believe she will need a resident dog in her new home to help her settle. Over time, as she becomes more confident in her new environment, we will assess whether she could be an only dog.

Passanda will need gentle guidance with house training and walking on a lead. Once she has mastered these skills, she would love to go on plenty of adventures and explore the world she has missed out on so far. All she really wants is a warm, loving home and someone who can give her all the fuss and attention she adores.

Passanda has a low-grade slipping patella, which will need monitoring in her new home for any future treatment, and she has had 2 mammary lumps removed at the time of her spay. These minor health matters will not stop this joyful girl from bringing endless love and happiness to the right family.

Behind her soulful eyes lies a gentle spirit who wants so much to be brave, but who is still finding her confidence in this big, unfamiliar world.

Pipper will be looking for a calm and quiet, adult only home with adopters who have experience with scared ex-breeding dogs. Although she is a very sweet girl, if she is suddenly startled she can panic and react, but with gentle handling and lots of patience, she is a really lovely girl.

She is slowly learning to walk on a harness and is doing well, though she does try to escape from it so it's important that she is double leaded to start with for her safety. Like so many who have never lived in a home, she will need kind adopters who can guide her through the basics, house training, building confidence, and understanding the rhythms of family life.

What will help her most is the presence of a kind resident dog in her new home, a companion she can rely on for comfort and reassurance as she adjusts to this new life. With their support, and the patience of her family, Pipper will begin to realise that she is safe, loved, and finally home.

Pipper has come to us with Queen Anne legs, meaning her legs point out slightly. Her third eyelid is covering her eye, but this doesn't seem to bother her, but may need to be assessed by her future vet. Currently, Pipper is being treated for a burst abscess on her shoulder, which is being cleaned daily.

She has come to us from a breeder and is full of love. She greets us with a wiggly bum and her little angelic face literally beams at you! Jess looks older than her years but she has had a hard life and she has some mammary lumps which our vet will have a look at when she is spayed.

Jess adores people and really wants to be everybody's friend so we don't think it will take her too long to settle into home life. She has never lived in a home so will need at least one other dog in her new home to show her the ropes and to help her learn about house training. We haven't tried her on a lead yet but again if she needs to learn about lead walking we don't think it will take her long to pick this up.

If you are looking for a dog to love and who will love you to the moon and back then look no further than Jess. She is going to make the most fabulous friend to share your life with.

At the time of her spay, the vets noted that she has inflamed skin and thickened teets that seem to cause her no problems.

She is a sweet and gentle girl who is easy to handle but is feeling a little worried and overwhelmed at the moment as she adjusts to her new surroundings.

Cally is a curious soul who enjoys playing with her kennel friends and finding comfort in their company. With love, patience, and plenty of TLC, we believe she will soon come out of her shell and show her lovely personality.

She will need a calm and quiet home with another kind and confident resident dog who can help guide her and show her how wonderful life in a family can be. As she has never lived in a home before, she will need understanding adopters who can help her learn about house training and give her time to get used to the sights and sounds of home life.

Cally has not yet learned to walk on a lead, so her new family will need to gently introduce this to her, helping her to gain confidence step by step.

In the right home, Cally will blossom into the most loyal and loving companion for a very lucky family.",09/15/2025

She has come to us from a breeder and is a friendly girl who loves a fuss and so we don't think it will take her too long to settle into home life. She is blossoming more and more every day and is a dream to look after.

Weedle is a gentle girl with the kindest nature, she’s calm, affectionate, and even shares her bed with her kennel friends. She will be looking for a home where there is another kind resident dog to be her friend and companion as all she has ever known is the company of other dogs.

She has recently started learning to walk on a lead and is doing so well already, so we think she will love going for walks and adventures with her new family. Weedle has never lived in a home before so her adopters will need to be kind and understanding as she settles in and learns all about home life and new skills like house training.

Weedle sits and waits patiently to be fussed when you enter the kennel. She is practically perfect in every way and will make a wonderful additional to any home. We would consider homing her with older dog-savvy children or teens who would allow her to settle in at her own pace.

Weedle has undergone a mammary strip surgery on the last mammary glands on the left-hand side. She also has a lump under her lower jaw that has been assessed by our vets. While the lump has not been sampled, it appears to be harmless and due to its location, it is in Weedle’s best interests to leave it as it is for now. It's possible it may require removal in the future and this is something her adopters vet will need to monitor and would not be covered by insurance. She has also been treated for a mild ear infection, which is now looking much better.

This gentle girl has been with us for a few weeks now, as when she first arrived, we noticed she was wobbly on her front legs and they had some weakness, causing her to walk with an abnormal gait. She has also had one seizure since being with us.

Woopy has been monitored by our vets during her time here. They suspect she may have some neurological issues, but have been unable to pinpoint a specific cause. Despite this, she manages well and is a lovely girl who so deserves to be in her forever home. Woopy will be available by donation and her adopters would need to be aware that anything relating to this would not be covered by insurance.

She is a very sweet natured girl who is much more confident when she's around other dogs, so she will need a home where there is already a kind and gentle resident dog who can help guide her and take her under their wing. Woopy is still a little shy, but she will now approach you and gently lick your fingers.

She has never lived in a home before, so her adopters will need to be kind and understanding as she settles in and learns all about home life as well as new skills like house training as well as how to walk on a lead.

This lovely girl is looking for a quiet, understanding home where she will be given all the time and support she needs. With love and TLC, we think she is going to blossom into the most amazing girl, so please don't leave her waiting too long.

When she first came to us, she was a very worried and timid girl, unsure of people and her new surroundings. Despite her nerves, it was clear right away that she had a gentle and sweet nature, and with love, patience, and reassurance she is beginning to show her true self.

Now in foster, Vespa is blossoming into a playful, cheeky, and affectionate little pup. She adores playing with her brother and would love a forever home with another kind and confident dog who can be her playmate and role model as she continues to grow. Like all young pups, Vespa is full of fun and mischief. She loves her toys, has even started learning to fetch a ball, and will thrive with adopters who can give her plenty of playtime and adventure.

She will need a secure garden where she can safely run, play, and explore. Toilet training is coming along well, though her new family should expect a few accidents as she continues to learn. She is also starting to walk on a harness and enjoys her walks, especially meeting new people and dogs, though she does get very excited! Puppy classes will be essential for Vespa to build her confidence, develop her social skills, and learn good manners.

As she has never lived in a home before, Vespa will need patient adopters who can gently guide her through all aspects of home life, including house training, lead walking, and basic puppy manners. She will also need to be spayed when old enough, as per her adoption agreement.

Vespa may be small, but she is full of character, charm, and potential. With the right family by her side, she will grow into a happy, confident, and loving companion. Whoever adopts her will be very lucky indeed.",09/15/2025

He tries his hardest to shy away from us humans and will need a calm and quiet home where he can settle in at his own pace and receive lots of love and TLC.

In a loving home, that offers plenty of patience, adventure, and guidance we are hopeful Vishu will grow into a confident, happy dog. Unfortunately, it seems as though these poor pups have not had very much formal handling and can be spooked quite easily, we are hopeful with time, and plenty of cuddles they will begin to understand our intentions! Vishu will need a kind and confident dog that he can look to as he settles in and can learn from as he grows. As well as an adult only home where he can feel safe and loved.

Vishu has never lived in a home before, so will need to learn all of his home manners from scratch and will need his new family to be patient as he learns house training, how to walk on a lead and so much more. Vishu would benefit from attending puppy classes to help build confidence, social skills, and good manners.

Vishu has come to us with an umbilical hernia which has been assessed by our vets and requires no action. With the right start, he will make a fantastic addition to any family.",09/15/2025

When he first came to us, he was a very worried little boy, easily spooked by new things and unsure about being handled. He would even sit up on his back legs with his front paws held close, like a tiny meerkat, endearing, but such a clear sign of how overwhelmed he was.

Vanity has since moved to foster and has started to blossom, and his true personality is beginning to shine through. Vanity will need another kind, confident canine friend in his forever home to help him feel secure and to join in with his games.

Like all puppies, Vanity is full of fun, mischief, and energy. He has discovered toys and loves nothing more than chasing after balls or playing with anything squeaky. He has also found his voice and isn’t shy about letting you know when he wants something! A secure garden will be essential for him so he can play safely and enjoy his zoomies.

Vanity is making good progress with his toilet training, though as with any young pup, his new family should expect a few accidents while he continues to learn. He walks nicely on a harness, though he gets very excited when meeting new dogs and people. Puppy classes will be a must for Vanity, to help him continue learning his manners and to grow into a well-rounded, confident dog.

He will need an adult-only home with adopters who can give him plenty of time, patience, and guidance as he continues his journey. With the right start, Vanity will grow into a loyal, loving, and fun companion. He is a beautiful boy with so much character, whoever adopts him will be very lucky indeed.",09/15/2025
Flash,/media/animal_images/Flash-15-08-25b.jpeg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/2601/,1 year,Male,Standard Poodle,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"07-06-25 Flash is a truly striking Standard Poodle who has come to us from a home as his owners no longer had time for him and couldn't offer him the exercise he requires. Although he has lived in a home before, Flash is a worried boy who finds new experiences and people quite daunting. Because of this, Flash is looking for an experienced, adult only home with adopters who have plenty of time, patience, and love to give. He needs adopters who won’t give up on him and who will allow him to settle in at his own pace.

Initially, Flash can be wary of new people and unsure of their intentions, but once you’ve gained his trust, he begins to show his affectionate and loyal nature. He forms strong bonds with those he feels safe around and shows a deep need for companionship. He does not cope well with being left alone and has shown signs of separation anxiety, getting very worried and anxious when left on his own. He will need an adopter who is able to be with him all of the time and who will work on this with him, slowly building up any time he is left. We are told he was crate trained in his previous home, which may help with this process.

Flash is particularly sensitive to loud or sudden noises, which can cause him to panic. He feels safest in quiet, familiar surroundings and finds walks outside of the rescue grounds very difficult at the moment. When taken beyond his comfort zone, he becomes overwhelmed and spins in circles in an attempt to return to safety. While he can walk on a lead, his adopters will need to help him grow in confidence very gradually and may need to begin with simply enjoying time in the garden or short walks in peaceful areas.

Flash would be best suited to being homed as an only dog as he can be grumbly when meeting other dogs. This is something his adopters will need to work on with him with patience and positive reinforcement. Because of this, he must only be allowed off lead in secure areas with no other dogs present. He also cannot live with cats or small animals and we are told he isn't a fan of pigeons or seagulls.

Flash will be looking for a calm and quiet home, where he can settle in at his own pace and where his adopters will help him settle into a consistent routine so he can feel safe and secure. We are told that he is house trained but he may need some reminders of this in his new home

Although he is currently worried about going for walks, he is an active breed who will need to be kept both mentally and physically stimulated. We have been told that he has previously done some agility and scent work, so once his confidence grows this is something he may like to explore again in the future. His previous owners also said he enjoyed being groomed and bathed, though we haven’t yet introduced this at the rescue.

This beautiful boy has so much potential in the right hands. If you have the time, experience, and understanding to give Flash the security and stability he needs, he will reward you with trust, loyalty, and love. Please don’t overlook him, he’s waiting for that one special person to believe in him.

Flash has an entropion in both eyes, which has been repaired by our vets but does have some dermatitis around his eyes.",09/15/2025

She was adopted in May but sadly her family decided that they could not meet her needs and made the hard decision to return her to her foster home. Torin has settled straight back in and enjoys a run in the fields and playing with her doggie pals. 

Torin is a sensitive soul and needs to be told she is a good girl, she is gentle and easy to be around and just loves to feel loved and safe. She walks beautifully on a lead and travels great, she sleeps all night and has been clean in the house since she arrived in foster. She can be left for a few hours and is fully crated trained. 

Torin could be homed as an only dog in the right circumstances, as long as her adopters had plenty of time to spend with her, but she get on well with other dogs so would be happy to share her home with another kind resident dog.

She is known as the perfect pupster in her foster home for a reason, because she is just that and her foster mum tells her every day how special she is.

Torin does have a sensitive tummy, so she’s currently on a specific dry food that suits her well, along with prebiotics in the morning. She’s been checked by the vet and has had blood tests done, and everything has come back normal, so her sensitivities are likely to be diet-related.

Opal is a beautiful 2-year-old Cockapoo who came to us from a breeder. Having never lived in a home before, she has spent her time learning to trust people and adjust to the world beyond the kennel. With the loving help of her foster family, Opal is now beginning to blossom into the gentle, curious dog we always knew she could be.

Opal is still a very scared girl, but she’s made incredible progress. She's completely house trained, happily spends time in the garden, enjoys watching the ducks, and even helps out with washing the car! While she’s not yet ready for cuddles in the traditional sense, she now accepts gentle strokes and ear tickles from her foster carer and is beginning to take treats (though only if you look away!).

She continues to draw comfort from the resident dogs in her foster home and will need at least one kind and confident dog in her new family to help guide her. Opal finds reassurance in their company and loves exploring alongside them. Her foster carers describe her as bright, inquisitive, and the perfect house guest.

Due to her ongoing fearfulness, Opal is only ready for a very special home, one with adopters who are experienced with very frightened dogs. She will need time, patience, and a deep understanding of how to help her continue building confidence at her own pace. An adult-only home is essential, and it must be quiet, calm, and secure.

Opal has already overcome so much, and while she may be a longer-term project, she will be endlessly rewarding to those who can offer her the love and safety she deserves. She truly is a precious soul waiting to shine in the right hands.",09/15/2025

Slumber is a petite husky with the sweetest soul. When she arrived in September, she was withdrawn and unsure of the world around her, but what a transformation we’ve seen! With time, patience, and the company of other dogs, Slumber is slowly but surely discovering joy.

Once too scared to engage, she now walks beautifully on a harness, enjoys gentle fuss, and even shows off her playful side when she thinks no one’s watching. She gets the zoomies in the yard, sticks close to people she trusts, and is starting to believe that life can be good.

Slumber is still shy and will need adopters who understand her past and are happy to take things at her pace. But she’s so worth the wait, a gentle, quirky girl with so much love to give.

The Home She Needs:
A calm, adult-only home
At least one confident, friendly dog (similar in size, she is only 16kg)
A secure garden for zoomies and quiet time
No cats, please!

Slumber has come so far, and with the love of a patient family, she’ll continue to blossom. If you're ready to help her write the next chapter of her story, apply today, she’s truly a hidden gem waiting to shine.

Slumber has come to us with a dystrophy and scarification of the last cornea, this does not seem to cause her pain or discomfort and does not impair her vision, but she will need to follow up with her future vets in the case that further treatment may be required in the future,",09/15/2025

Glow Worm is a 2-year-old male Bichon Frise who has come to us from a breeder and is now learning about life in a loving foster home. Before arriving in foster care, he had never lived in a home, so the world is still a very big and sometimes scary place for this sweet, sensitive boy.

Glow Worm is still quite hand-shy and finds human interaction a bit overwhelming at times, especially when it comes to being picked up or handled. That said, he is now allowing gentle handling when needed and has even had a few baths and grooms without too much worry. His foster family is taking things slowly and kindly, and he’s responding with quiet bravery in his own time.

While he is cautious with people, Glow Worm truly lights up when he’s with other dogs. He absolutely thrives in their company, often playing, snuggling, and following their lead. For this reason, he must be rehomed with a kind and confident resident dog who can help him continue learning and give him the reassurance he needs.

In his foster home, Glow Worm has started to play with toys, especially nylabones, and he's discovered a real love of rolling in puddles during outdoor adventures! His fosterers recently took him to a secure field to practice wearing a lead, and although he wasn’t ready to walk on it yet, he had a wonderful time splashing about and just being a dog. He’s not ready for walks just yet, and house training is still ongoing, but his foster family is supporting him gently every step of the way.

Glow Worm is also quite the character at mealtimes—he’s vocal when food is being prepared and isn’t shy about letting you know he’s ready for a treat!

Because of his background and fears, Glow Worm is looking for an experienced, adult-only home with calm, patient adopters who understand that he will need time, reassurance, and a gentle routine to help him grow in confidence. He will also need regular grooming to keep his coat comfortable and healthy.

Glow Worm has his transport document from Ireland and is ready to find a forever home that will celebrate his small victories, offer him kindness every day, and love him just as he is. In the right home, this beautiful boy has so much potential to shine.",09/15/2025

He has arrived here from a breeder and is very matted. Although he is shy he is easy to handle but he hates the clippers. He will be groomed here, but his adopters are going to need a very kind and experience groomer to ensure he is kept matt free going forwards.

Buddy will need a home where there is at least one other dog to help him adjust and settle into life in a home as he has never been inside a home before. He will need to learn about house training but he will watch his new friend(s) and start to copy what they do which will help him pick this up faster. He will also need to learn about walking on a lead and this should start in the garden before attempting to walk him outside.

We don't think it will take Buddy long to understand how great his new life is and he will start to relax and return his adopter's love tenfold.

Her elderly owner, struggling with mental health, had become overwhelmed, and while the dogs were not intentionally mistreated, they went without proper care. Now safe with us, Oakley is finally experiencing love and stability.

Oakley is a very shy and cautious girl who finds new experiences overwhelming. She is not used to being handled but is curious and will approach people when she feels safe. She has always lived with other dogs and finds great comfort in their company, so she will need at least one kind and confident resident dog in her new home to guide and reassure her as she settles.

Oakley will need a calm, quiet, adult-only home where she can be allowed to settle at her own pace. She has never lived in a home before, so her adopters will need to be patient and understanding as she learns about home life, house training, and other new skills. She can now walk on a harness, although she can become a little panicky at times, so she will need continued practice in a calm and supportive environment. Due to her size, a very secure garden with high fences will be essential.

One of several dogs rescued from neglect, she endured a difficult and fragile beginning, including a pregnancy where, sadly, none of her puppies survived. Despite all this, Oxalis has shown nothing but love, resilience, and a gentle spirit.

Since moving to foster, she has begun to blossom beautifully. She is fully house trained, walks confidently on a lead, and is calm and silent when crated at night. Oxalis adores everyone she meets and is starting to explore play with other dogs, often staying close to those she trusts for comfort and reassurance. Her affectionate nature shines through every day, she loves being near people, offering cuddles and gentle companionship to those around her.

Oxalis will thrive in a calm, quiet, adult-only home with a kind and confident resident dog to guide her and help her feel secure. She has learned so much already, but everything about home life is still new to her, so patience, love, and gentle encouragement will continue to help her grow in confidence.

This beautiful girl has already overcome so much, and now all she wants is a family to call her own, a home where she can feel safe, loved, and cherished forever.

She was rescued from a home in heartbreaking conditions, where her elderly owner, struggling with mental health challenges, could no longer provide proper care. Though never intentionally mistreated, Onyx and her companions went without the love, attention, and care they deserved. Now, safe with us, Onyx is finally experiencing the stability and affection she has always craved.

This beautiful, gentle giant has blossomed in her new environment. She adores human attention, quietly soaking up fuss and affection whenever she can, yet she remains soft and unassuming. Onyx is also remarkably composed – she ignores cats completely and walks calmly past reactive dogs, showing a confidence tempered with incredible patience.

Onyx thrives with the company of a kind and confident resident dog, who can offer guidance and reassurance. While she has always lived with other dogs, she may, in the right experienced home, be happy as an only dog. She has had to move kennels a couple of times, not because of anything she’s done, but because other dogs picked on her, yet through it all, her gentle nature has shone through.

Having never lived in a home before, Onyx will need patient adopters to help her settle in, learn new skills such as house training, and become accustomed to daily routines. She is beginning to enjoy walks on a lead, though this is still very new to her. Due to her size, a secure garden with high fences is essential.

Onyx arrived in poor physical condition and has made remarkable progress. She has cauliflower ear and polyps in her ears, and her teeth are very worn, with some missing and five extracted during her care. She has had two mammary lumps removed at the time of her spay. Her skin was sore and dry but is now looking much healthier, and she is steadily gaining weight thanks to small, frequent meals packed with nutrients.

This special girl is full of love, patience, and potential – a truly endearing companion who is ready to find a calm, safe, and loving home where she can finally feel cherished and part of a family.

He’s a curious and inquisitive boy, full of character and charm. Despite his constant tail-wagging, Jack is easy to handle and always happy to join us for a bit of attention.

At the moment, Jack is feeling a little unsure and finds comfort in the company of his kennel friends. We feel it would be best for him to be rehomed with another dog for support and companionship. That said, we’ll continue to assess his confidence while he’s with us to see if he could adapt to being an only dog.

As Jack has never lived in a home before, he’ll need to learn the basics of home life, including toilet training. This transition is usually much easier with a resident dog around to show him the ropes.

Jack can already walk nicely on a lead, so once he’s settled, he’ll enjoy one or two walks around the neighbourhood with his new canine companion.

Jack has arrived a little underweight but with good nutrition he should start to fill out. He also has some lip fold dermatitis around his lower jaw. Our vets noted that when Jack walks he twists his hips slightly and there is also some asymmetry of his back legs. He has been checked by a specialist vet who has said that his hips are fine, but there is some muscle wastage and so with gentle exercise and as his muscle tone increases, this should start to improve. He has advised that he may benefit from having physio in his new home and this will need to continue to be monitored by his adopters and their vet.

With his lovely nature and winning personality, Jack is already proving to be a favourite here at the rescue. We’re sure it won’t be long before he wins someone’s heart.",09/15/2025

As she has never lived in a home before, Hazlewood’s adopters will need to be patient and understanding as she settles in and learns all about the world of home life. This will include new skills such as house training and learning to walk on a lead.

With plenty of love, reassurance, and gentle guidance, we think she is going to blossom into the most wonderful and loving girl, so please don't leave her waiting.

Our vets have noted that she has a Grade 3-4 heart murmur. She doesn't require any medication for this at the moment, but her adopters and their vet will need to monitor this going forward. She also has some areas of hormonal alopecia, which should hopefully grow back once she has been spayed.

Nela,/media/animal_images/Nela-13-09-25e.jpg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/2130/,5 years,Female,Crossbreed,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Please meet the wonderful Nela! A big girl with an even bigger personality who has come all the way from Spain to find her forever home. She is a total cuddle monster who just loves fuss and attention! Almost as much as she loves to play and have fun. She has the most amazing zest for life and you just can't help but fall in love with her.

She has settled in so well and is just such a goofball! All she wants is to be loved and spend time with her humans.

Nela will be looking for an active home, with adopters who have plenty of time to spend with her and will keep her both physically and mentally stimulated. She walks well on a lead, but can be a bit strong at times which is why we’ve started halti training her. She’s picked it up like a pro and is an absolute joy to walk. She now enjoys long walks with one of our regular volunteers.

Nela does get along with other dogs but can be very exuberant and excited in her play with them and so we think she would be best suited to being homed as an only dog, but with the right match we would consider homing her with another playful resident dog.

She has likely never lived in a home before but since being with us she is almost 99% kennel clean, so we don't think it will take her long to pick it up in her forever home.

Nela is being treated for Otitis externa or interna as her ears appear sore to the touch.

She is a wonderful girl who is full of confidence and cannot wait to meet her forever family.

Nela has travelled from Spain and has received negative test results for Brucellosis, Leishmania, Heartworm, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma. She also has a passport.",09/15/2025
Chill,/media/animal_images/Chill-07-09-25a.jpeg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/4858/,4 months,Male,Collie,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Chill has come to us from a breeder and is now searching for his forever home. When he arrived, he was a very scared boy, but his confidence has come on really well over the past few weeks and now, once he knows you he will approach you for some gentle fuss and to play. He has recently moved to a foster home where he is settling in well.

He could be homed as an only dog in the right circumstances as long as his adopters had plenty of time to spend with him, but he could also live with another kind resident dog. He doesn't always have the best manners when meeting other dogs, so they would need to be laid back and not mind having a cheeky puppy racing around.

Chill doesn’t yet walk on a lead, but he’ll be looking for an active home with adopters who can keep him both physically and mentally stimulated once he gains confidence.

He’s still just a puppy and with time, kindness, and consistency, Chill will blossom into the cheeky, happy boy he was always meant to be. As he has never lived in a home before, he’ll also need guidance with house training and learning all about family life.

With the right support, Chill’s journey from frightened to flourishing will be a truly rewarding one for the family lucky enough to welcome him home.

His adopters will need to take him to puppy socialisation classes and agree to have him neutered at the appropriate age as per the adoption agreement.

Chill has a travel document.",09/15/2025

She is now living in a foster home where she is settling in well and enjoying family life.

She is a gentle natured girl, who was a little timid when she first arrived, but is already starting to grow in confidence. Cora will be looking for a home with another kind resident dog who will be her friend and companion.

She had never lived in a home before moving to her foster home, but she is adapting incredibly quickly and has been clean in the house so far. She eats well, travels well in the car and is also sleeping through the night without a peep.

Cora walks well on a lead and is a very clever and active girl, who would love to find an equally active home where she can be kept both mentally and physically stimulated. She may also enjoy attending obedience training or mantrailing. She loves running around the secure field and has good recall, although doesn't tend to like to stray far from you anyway.

Cora loves a fuss and one of her favourite things is to retrieve balls. We are told that Cora has previously lived around livestock, cats, and children without issue, which makes her a very adaptable girl. With love and patience, Cora has the potential to become a truly loyal and devoted companion.",09/15/2025
Miranda,/media/animal_images/Miranda-13-09-25a.jpg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/3765/,6 years,Female,Bichon Frise,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Miranda is a beautiful, sensitive girl who has come to us from a breeder to begin her new life. She was extremely frightened and overwhelmed when she first arrived, but she has slowly been making progress and coming out of her shell. She is still a scared girl who is very worried about being handled by humans, but she is trying so hard to be brave and is okay to be handled with a calm and gentle approach.

Miranda will need a very calm and quiet, adult only home with adopters who have experience with nervous ex-breeding dogs. She will need adopters who are willing to take things at her pace, never rushing her, and who can offer a peaceful environment where she can begin to feel safe.

Miranda finds great comfort in the company of other dogs, and she will absolutely need at least one other kind and confident resident dog in her new home. A canine friend will be essential to help guide her, show her that people can be trusted, and encourage her as she slowly begins to come out of her shell.

Miranda has never lived in a home before, so her adopters will need to be patient and understanding as she learns all about home life and new skills like house training. She doesn't yet walk on a lead and will need to practice in a secure garden once she starts to feel braver.

She arrived with sore skin, which has been treated and has also had 15 teeth extracted at the time of her spay, so would benefit from a soft food diet going forwards.

Miranda is looking for a very special home. She may never be a “typical” dog, but what she truly needs is a family who will love her exactly as she is, cherishing her unconditionally and giving her all the time, patience, and kindness she deserves. Her journey won’t be quick, but for the right home, it will be one of the most rewarding. Could you be the safe haven she’s been waiting for?",09/15/2025

Maya is a gentle and nervous girl who will need a kind and confident resident dog in her new home to help her feel safe and guide her as she learns the ropes of home life. She is happiest when she is in someone’s arms, enjoying a cuddle, and she is a truly gorgeous little lady with a heart full of love to give.

As Maya has never lived in a home before, she will need patient guidance to learn all the basics, including house training and walking on a lead. She would benefit from a secure garden to start, where she can explore safely and build confidence at her own pace.

Maya will flourish in a calm, understanding household where she can feel safe, settle into family life, and gradually gain confidence. Once she feels secure, she will enjoy cuddles, gentle adventures, and being included in all aspects of home life.

Maya truly deserves a kind, patient family who will give her the time and love she needs to blossom.

Our vets have noted that she has a cataract in her right eye which will need to be monitored.",09/15/2025

She is a sweet but scared little girl who is feeling overwhelmed by all the changes in her life. Izzy relies heavily on her kennel friends for comfort, so she will need at least one other kind and confident resident dog in her new home to help guide and reassure her, however she can be a little dominant with small dogs, so any dogs in her new home would need to be larger than her.

Izzy will be looking for a calm and quiet, adult-only home where she can take things at her own pace and gently build her confidence. As she has never lived in a home before, she will need patient adopters who can help her learn about house training and all the new experiences of family life. She will also need to start practicing walking on a lead in a secure garden until she is ready to explore further.

With love, patience and the support of her new doggy friend, Izzy will slowly learn that the world is a safe place and blossom into a much-loved companion.

She is a shy little lady, but very easy to handle, and she has already shown us her calm and cosy approach to life. Hollis prefers snuggles in her bed and enjoys taking gentle strolls around the kennel spaces.

She gets along wonderfully with her kennel friends and relies on their company for comfort, so she will need a kind resident dog in her new home to help guide her and give her the reassurance she needs as she settles in and finds her paws.

As Hollis has never lived in a home before, she will need to learn all about house training, lead training, and the other basics of home life. With time and patience, we’re sure she will adapt to her new surroundings.

Hollis will be seeing our vets to address a few issues she has arrived with. She will need her ears cleaned and a dental as she has some broken canines. She is also very overweight at the moment, so her diet and exercise will need to be managed carefully to help her achieve a healthier weight. Our vets have also determined that she has a low-grade luxating patella and a Grade 4 heart murmur. She doesn't require any medication for this, but it is something her adopters and their vet will need to monitor going forwards.

Despite these challenges, Hollis has the sweetest nature and will make a truly lovely companion in the right home.

Trust,/media/animal_images/Trust-04-09-25a.jpeg.640x640_q80_crop_progressive_upscale.jpg,https://www.manytearsrescue.org/adopt/dogs/2541/,6 years,Female,Bichon Frise x Maltese,,SA14 7HB,Many Tears Animal Rescue,"Trust has come to us from a breeder to find her forever home. When she arrived with us, she was very worried and overwhelmed and it was clear that she had never known love or kindness before. She has now moved to a foster home where she is settling in well and starting to learn all about home life.

She is still a very worried girl and is very scared of human hands at the moment. She will let you gently stroke her if she is in her crate or bed, but she would prefer to not be touched and still needs to learn that human hands can be kind. Despite this, she was very brave when her fosterer gave her a bath and let her bath and dry her.

Trust is a sweet girl, who will wag her tail happily when you speak to her and is happy to come and get a treat from you as she really does love her food! She is already making so much progress and doing so well.

What Trust needs most is a calm and quiet, adult only home, ideally with adopters who have experience with nervous ex-breeding dogs and will allow her to settle in at her own pace. Most importantly, she will need at least one other kind and confident resident dog in her new home who can be her guide, friend, and source of comfort. She is in foster with a cat and so could be homed with a dog savvy feline.

Before moving to her foster home, she had never lived in a home before so everything will be very new and scary for her at first. She is doing very well with her house training and is now mostly clean in the house. She has also started learning to walk on a lead and harness, but needs more practice to gain confidence.

Trust may be scared now, but with time and gentle care, we know she has the potential to blossom into a loving companion. If you can open your heart to this dear girl and help her learn that she is safe and loved, please don't leave her waiting.

She has an undershot jaw, but this doesn't bother her, she also had 3 teeth removed at the time of her spay.",09/15/2025

He enjoys chasing after toys, splashing in the paddling pools at Battersea Old Windsor and stretching his long legs with a good run. He is full of energy and fun and he’s guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.

He is a clever boy who already knows several commands such as ‘sit’, ‘down’ and ‘paw’ and with his love of a tasty treat, is eager to learn even more. He’s making great progress with his training, especially when it comes to passing other dogs calmly and he will thrive with new owners who can continue helping him build confidence in this area.

Dobby can feel a bit unsure around new people, especially men, but with time and patience he makes friends quickly and soon shows his affectionate side.

He is looking for a calm, but active home where he can continue his training, enjoy playtime and get all the love he deserves. In the right environment this cheeky chap will blossom. He is fun, super-smart and sure to make you smile every day.

This big friendly giant has a great history and good basics due to the dedication of his previous owner. Such as being fully house trained, and a wonderful sit! He loves people and gets a lot from human interaction but can get quite excited and needs gentle reminders not to jump up!

Duke will need a home with a private garden for burning off all his energy, and would be best suited to a home with multiple people to support his ongoing training. He is a smart and playful boy who is eager to please - he does not quite realise that lap dogs are not meant to be over 40 kilos!

Change seems to be a trigger for Duke and he found his initial few weeks with us very stressful, demonstrating humping behaviours towards people and dogs. Although the behaviour towards people has all but gone, we are still sending him home with the recommendations for him to stay on lead when out and about and therefore will need experienced large breed dog owners who understand all the quirks that come with a dog of his size and temperament.

Sky,,https://www.battersea.org.uk/dogs/dog-rehoming-gallery/sky,"Age 4 Years, 4 Months",Female,Siberian Husky,,SW8 4AA,Battersea Dogs Home,"Sky is an intelligent, cheeky and bold Husky X Malinois who is looking for an active, experienced home. Sky is located at Battersea Old Windsor.
With people she knows, Sky is affectionate and playful, enjoying games with tennis balls and ragger toys. She has shown worry around having her harness put on by people she is less bonded with, so her owners will need to go slowly and work on this. Sky is a clever dog and has learnt to open doors, so will need owners who can be one step ahead of her at home - she likes to be kept busy and engaged so would suit owners who are looking for a fun training partner.
Sky is friendly and enjoys a game with other dogs, but sometimes has enough and wants her own space so she would prefer to be the only dog in her new home.
Her new owners will need to have experience of Huskies or Malinois and be aware of their needs and traits. She has some lovely basic training in place from her previous home and is housetrained, travels well in the car, and could be left alone for short periods of time. She is naturally apprehensive around new people so would best suit a home where there are not lots of visitors. It will be essential for Sky to have her own, secure garden so that she can run off lead. Recall training will need to be consistent and may take some time to achieve, so owners may wish to look at hiring secure fields where she can really stretch her legs.
Sky is loyal once she knows you, but is a dog who definitely knows what she likes and does at times like her own space, which should be respected. She will need training around her handling which new owners must be committed to.

Sky is a clever, cheeky livewire with a big personality - this bright spark knows her own mind and is ready to keep you on your toes - and fill your days with fun.

Susie was sadly returned to Battersea as her owners were moving and couldn't take her with them. Susie is a sweet little lady with a sensitive soul and finds it difficult to meet new people, although she does warm up slowly given time and will become your best friend once bonded. Susie was described as an affectionate and playful dog once she'd settled into her new home and learned to trust her new family, she can become a little over excited when playing and loved nothing more than to pull her owners socks off.

Susie is looking for an adult only home where she is the only pet, she will need multiple carers so that she never feels alone and would prefer to live in a quiet area with a low population of dogs or accessible quiet routes. Once Susie has settled, she will make the sweetest addition to any home and is sure to bring lots of joy to her new family.

He may be big, but he's a real softy at heart and has been a little worried of the big wide world around him, so new owners will need to help give him the reassurance and training to continue to build his confidence.

Booma can be a little unsure when meeting people for the first time, but is extremely loving and affectionate once he builds a bond with them. So he will need owners who are happy and willing to give him the time that he needs to make friends with them and any new people as well as settle into a new life with them.

He has been unsure of how to play with dogs but can sometimes be a little unsure of how to go about interacting with them, so he will need owners with a little experience of socialising dogs, who are willing to help him build up his confidence and social skills.

Life in general can be a little scary at times for Booma, but he has been make great strides in building his confidence here at Battersea, and he would love owners who help him find his way and build his confidence with the wide world a little bit at a time.

Booma's size is matched only by his heart and the love that he has to give. If you give him a little love he will give you back that love a 100 times. Once he's made friends with you it's for life and he'll be your snuggle buddy no matter what.

Molly is a sweet young girl with a lot of love to give. She loves her people and is always eager to interact with them and have a gentle fuss. She loves dogs and people and is more than happy to go over and say hello.

She gets a confidence boost from other dogs as she enjoys interacting with them and seeks out reassurance from dogs when with them. Therefore Molly could live with another dog that is the right match for her.

Her favourite thing in the world is toys! She loves a tennis ball and rope toys! She has shown some good impulse control around toys and is good at exchanging which is a great way to bond with her.

Understandably, he was quite overwhelmed and worried when he first arrived at our busy London site, but in time he has grown in confidence and is a typically exuberant young lad. He is worried when meeting new people but makes friends quickly – he has also shown lovely social skills when meeting other dogs on site and could live with another confident and tolerant role model dog.

Boscoe is at an age where he will be developing his social skills so it will be important for new owners to socialise him with a variety of different breeds, ages and sexes to ensure he grows into a well-mannered adult. As he was a stray one his first arrival before he was brought back into our care from a loving home, we have only limited information on what his behaviours are like in the home and new owners will need to commit to training Boscoe at this key age as he is likely to grow into a large dog. New owners must be dedicated to teaching Boscoe how to make the right choices so he may thrive.

As a young boy, he will require a private garden for distraction free training and to burn off his energy. He will also need owners with minimal leaving hours that can be built up gradually over time. Boscoe has had a few occasions of becoming overstimulated so will need owners who are experienced and confident in providing ongoing training when he becomes quite excitable!

He is enthusiastic, bright and keen to learn and just waiting for new owners who can give him the patience and love he deserves.

He is based at Battersea Old Windsor.

Kenzo has a worried side, especially around being handled and meeting new people. He will need patient new owners that are able to work with him at his own pace and read his body language when he is feeling uncomfortable. In Kenzo’s previous home he was house trained, was starting to get used to travelling in the car and enjoyed sunbathing in the garden.

Kenzo is a large dog and is strong on lead, new owners will need to be comfortable walking a stronger dog and be prepared to do some lead walking training.

Kenzo will need his own private and secure garden where he can run around and burn off his energy. He does have a history of chasing small animals so wouldn’t be suited to living with cats or rabbits etc.

Here at Battersea Old Windsor Kenzo has enjoyed rolling in sand pits, having dog ice cream treats and lounging on his bed.

Kenzo has been doing some training around other dogs and we feel he could potentially live with a female dog that could be a nice role model for him.

At heart, he's a gentle dog who's learning to feel confident in the world around him. Danny thrives in a calm environment and with the correct approach we are sure he will blossom into a loyal and loving companion.

In his previous home, Danny formed a strong bond with his owner, so is looking for a multi-carer household where everyone shares in his care ensuring he feels secure without becoming overly attached to one person.

Danny is spending some time in a temporary foster home and settled in very quickly, he has shown to be housetrained and happy to potter in the garden or snooze on a nice soft bed. One of his favourite places to walk is a quiet nature reserve, he even enjoys a little paddle in the stream.

He has a playful side, especially with soft, fluffy toys and can get very excited. He also loves sunbathing and will happily find a sunbeam to snooze in.

Danny is a dog who likes his own space when he is resting, so we would advise his new owners to have some clear areas, and his own beds, where he will not be disturbed.

He has bursts of fun Greyhound play times - doing zoomies and throwing toys around, then he likes a big snooze on a soft bed.

Danny prefers calm introductions with other dogs and quite often moves himself away. He would prefer to be the only dog in the home, but would enjoy some walking buddies. He is fond of car travel, laying down and relaxing for the journey.

If you are looking for an endearing companion and are prepared for some training, Danny is ready to meet you. You will be rewarded with plenty of love and some Greyhound leaning!

He is looking for owners who are familiar with his breed, or other brachycephalic dogs, due to some of his health needs and management needed to help keep him healthy and happy.

Gnocchi is friendly with everyone he meets; a bit too friendly at times and sometimes needs some help to keep calm as he can jump up. With other dogs, he greets them very enthusiastically and likes to play but can be too excitable for some dogs, and needs to live as the only pet in his new home whilst he learns some more appropriate games with dogs on his walks.

He is a little apprehensive about trips to the vets and some aspects of being handled, so will need some support in this area as well as confidence building around daily tasks such as having his face or skin cleaned.

Toys are a firm favourite for Gnocchi and he likes chewing on rubber toys or tennis balls. He also loves to play a little game of fetch with a ball. Due to his breed traits, he will not be able to do lots of exercise and will need fun things to do at home, as he is an intelligent dog who likes to be kept occupied. He also loves to sit on your lap having some fuss, often nudging for more attention. Gnocchi has so much love and personality and for dedicated owners he'll be lots of fun.

Kyzah came to us through no fault of his own. He was described as an excitable and playful lad with his previous owners, who would sometimes struggle to be left alone in the house. With other dogs, he was similarly a playful boy.

With us, we have seen the same playful and bouncy lad who loves human attention and zooming around in paddock. He does also enjoy his toys, but can get a little overexcited by them and jump up for more playtime. With dogs, we have similarly seen a bouncy lad, who loves some bully style play and chase games. He has at times shown sexual behaviours around other dogs, however is able to take breaks and be called away. For these reasons, we believe he is best suited to being the only dog in his new home with his socialisation taking place outside.

Kyzah is looking for a home with owners who are experienced around over excitable Bull breeds and are keen to keep up with his needs and training. He will need a private and secure garden. As an adolescent American Bulldog type, he still has a lot of room to grow, so new owners would need to have the strength and knowledge to socialise him correctly to ensure he is a well rounded adult with other dogs moving forward.

Lovely Luna is a 4 year old shepherd who is looking for a new home. She is housetrained, and can be left for periods of the day. She enjoys having attention from her family, and is very playful. Luna enjoys going for on lead walks at the beach at quiet times. 

Luna can be strong on lead and vocal when dogs approach, which we are currently working on to make her more comfortable in this environment. Once she feels you are part of her family, she will be your friend for life. Potential adopters will need to visit Luna a few times to build her trust. 

Luna is one of our Home 2 Home dogs and is living with her family while we look for a home for her. We see her regularly for training and trips out. All viewings will be with us at Oak Tree.

Older, Wiser, Still Full of Wiggles – Meet Jerry!

Meet our handsome 10 year old staffy, Jerry. He travels well in the car and adores getting outside for walks. Jerry can have dog walking buddies would will need to be the only dog in the home, to allow him to settle into his new life.

Jerry would benefit from a secure garden to potter around in but would be equally happy without providing his new owner can get him out regularly for toilet breaks. ",09/15/2025

Rex is a fabulous 3-year-old Greyhound who has joined us through the Greyhound Retirement Scheme. A true gentleman, Rex walks beautifully on the lead, travels well in the car, and has a calm, affectionate nature once he gets to know you.

Meet Riley – The Happy-Go-Lucky Hound

Say hello to Riley, a 3-year-old Greyhound with a big heart and an even bigger personality! Riley has come to us through the Greyhound Retirement Scheme and is now ready to find his forever home.

This cheeky chap is always smiling and loves meeting new friends—whether it’s people or other dogs. He’s a social butterfly on his walks, happily greeting everyone he passes. Despite his enthusiasm, Riley walks very nicely on the lead and is a calm, well-mannered travel companion in the car.

Riley could live with dog-savvy children aged 8 and up, and he’d enjoy sharing his home with a calm female dog. He would love a secure garden to show off his impressive zoomies, but would be equally content in a home that can offer regular toilet breaks and outdoor time.

With his chilled personality and friendly nature, Riley takes everything in his stride. He’s the perfect mix of playful and laid-back—and he’s more than ready to settle into a loving new home.

If you’re looking for a joyful, easygoing companion, Riley could be the one for you!

Meet Layla – Sweet, Cheeky, and Ready for a Fresh Start

Lovely Layla is on the lookout for her forever home! With her sweet (and slightly cheeky!) personality, Layla has won the hearts of our team and absolutely adores spending quality time with staff. She's a dog who thrives on human connection and would love a home where she can continue to build that special bond.

Layla is at her happiest when she’s off-lead in our sensory garden, where she can sniff, explore, and enjoy some freedom. She’s also very foody, which makes training a fun and rewarding experience. While she hasn't shown much interest in toys just yet, we’re confident her playful side will shine through once she’s settled into a loving home.

Layla can live with dog-savvy children aged 14+, and while she’s currently looking for a home where she’ll be the only dog, she’d still enjoy meeting up with friendly walking buddies.

If you're looking for a loyal companion with lots of love (and character!) to give, Layla could be the perfect match for you.",09/15/2025

Say hello to Reggie, a sweet-natured French Bulldog with a heart full of love and a stumpy tail that never stops wagging! Reggie is looking for a forever home where he can continue to enjoy the comforts of family life and share his affectionate, playful spirit.

Reggie adores people and is happiest when he's around those who love him back. He walks beautifully on the lead, enjoys getting out and about for gentle strolls, and has a fun, cheeky side when it's time to play. That said, he's equally content enjoying quieter days snuggled up indoors.

He would thrive in a home with a neutered female dog and could live with children aged 10 and over who understand how to interact respectfully with pets. Reggie has come from a home environment and is well-adjusted to family life.

Due to his breed, Reggie must be kept cool and safe during the warmer months—no long walks in the heat, and plenty of shade and fresh water are a must!

If you're looking for a loyal, loving companion who brings the perfect balance of fun and chill, Reggie could be the dog for you. He’s ready and waiting to meet his new family.",09/15/2025

 Meet Ronnie – The Toy-Loving Frenchie with a Big Heart!


Ronnie is a 4-year-old French Bulldog with a suitcase full of his favourite toys and a whole lot of love to give. This chunky little chap is bursting with character—cheeky, charming, and always ready to be the centre of attention. Whether he's showing off his toy collection or trotting happily on his lead, Ronnie knows how to make people smile.

He’s looking for a new home where he can thrive. Ronnie could live with a neutered female dog and children aged 10 and up who understand his playful but sometimes boisterous nature. He travels well, walks beautifully on lead, and absolutely adores off-lead play—so a secure garden would be a dream come true for him.

Ronnie’s on a gentle mission to shed a few kilos to help him live his healthiest life, and he’d love a family who can support him with fun, active routines and a balanced diet. In return, he’ll offer endless affection, toy-sharing (well, maybe), and that irresistible Frenchie charm.

If you’re ready for a loyal companion who brings laughter, cuddles, and a touch of mischief, Ronnie might just be your perfect match ",09/15/2025

She’s incredibly affectionate and adores human company — cuddles, belly rubs, and spending quality time with her people are some of her absolute favorite things. Luna would thrive in a home where she’s the only dog, as she prefers to have all the love and attention to herself. That said, she’s perfectly polite when meeting and walking with other dogs outside the home.

I have come into the centre as a stray so my past isn't clear but I have quickly become very popular here with the staff due to my lovely character.

I am a real pleasure to walk, I will just need to build my confidence up a bit so will be looking to my new owner for reassurance, particularly if we see big heavy traffic or loud scary things. Again, I may just need a bit of reassurance when meeting new people as I can be a bit shy and worried. I am well mannered and gentle and love to play....one of my favourite games is fetch.

Once I trust you, I love to have a cuddle, and you will notice me leaning in against you and trying to hop on your lap, so be prepared to be loved lots by me. Because I am so happy to be around my special people, I probably wont enjoy being left for too long. From what little the staff do know about me, they understand that I have lived with both cats and dogs with no issues. Although I am known to guard my food and potentially my toys, so this would need to be managed carefully in the home and I will only be suitable for older teenagers or an adult only home.

If you think you could give me the forever home I deserve, please submit your interest x

I'm all about living a life full of fun and adventure. There's nothing I love more than getting out of my kennel and exploring the world around me. My carers here at NAWT have been taking me on special expeditions off-site and I'm a really good boy every time. I just love being outside, seeing new sights and smelling new smells. Sometimes when I'm out, I come across another dog and I'm always keen to go over and say hello. I also love to go to secure areas where I can be let off lead to have a run around. I'm very gentle when I'm around people and I can be a big soppy sweetheart when I want to nuzzle up for a cuddle. I can't wait to have someone at home with me all the time so we can become the best of friends.

I'm looking for a family who will be able to take me out on lots of adventures and give me the chance to experience lots of new fun things in life. I'd also like to be able to be with someone for most of the day so I don't get too lonely. I might like to share my home with another dog, as long as we have some successful meets at the centre first, but I don't want to live with cats.

I'm Bryn, I'm 3 years old and I've been on quite the rescue journey recently. NAWT saved me when my future wasn't looking so bright, and when I first came here it was all so confusing and scary. I really struggled to trust anyone who wasn't one of my main carers at first, and the idea of being able to walk around the centre meeting new people and other dogs just seemed impossible in those first couple of weeks but thanks to the support I've had, my confidence has grown so much, I'm like a whole new me!

I've now taken pride of place in a kennel next to all the other dogs and I'm doing really well. When it's time for me to go out on a walk, I get so excited that I do a little bum wiggle and I can't wait to get that lead on and head out on an adventure. I'm even brave enough to stop and say hello to people when I pass by them now too, I like to give their hand a gentle sniff and then I left them give me a little scratch on the head before I carry on my travels. My kennel is right opposite the kitchen which is great because it means I get to spy on the team as they make my dinners, I've got to make sure they give me all the tastiest delights and then I do a happy dance as they bring it over to me.

I'm looking for a kind and compassionate owner who will continue to support me with learning new things and building my confidence. I might like to live with another laid back dog, but we would need to meet a few times first to see how we get on. I'd rather not live with any cats or small animals though and it's best I live with teenagers and adults only, as children can be a bit too unpredictable for me.

I might not have had the best start, I came to the centre as an unclaimed stray but I’m so excited about starting my new life and finding a family to love me.

I love being with people so much, and I especially love it when it's time for a cuddle. When I'm feeling the need for a little extra affection, I'll lean my head across you to rest my chin on your shoulder for a good old snuggle! Some people have tried to suggest that I'm too big to be a lap dog, but I'm having none of it, cuddle time please!

I haven't had much training in my early life, so this is something I'm going to need my new owners to help me work on. I've made a start with the team here and I'm already doing well, it helps that I'm a very clever boy and I pick things up quite easily. I really like it when I make people happy so I love learning new ways to be told I'm a good boy.

As I'm so clever, I'm also very inquisitive and I love to go out on walks and explore the world around me. I'm always game for a good sniff-spection if I spot something interesting. Maybe we could start up a neighbourhood watch team once I come home with you, I think I'd be good at that!

I might be able to live with another calm, big dog after a few play dates – I’m a sociable guy but but cats and smaller animals are a big no from me. I'm also quite a big bouncy lad, so it's best I live with teenagers and adults only.

Ok, so I guess I'm actually quite a big potato, in fact, the vets have told me I'm a bit too big and I need to lose a lot of weight to help me get fit and healthy. I'm not too keen on the idea so far, my new healthy diet is a bit boring, but my daily walks and exercise are fun, especially when I get to play with the other dogs!

I am very much loved by my current family but they have come to realise that their busy family homelife just isn't something I enjoy - so I am looking for a quieter pace of life now!
I am a sweet and affectionate boy once you know me, who loves having a cuddle and sitting on laps. I can be playful but will also sunbathe all day long given half the chance.
I am a bit of an anxious boy and a reluctant walker. I don't enjoy busy urban life, (you wont catch me in a cafe or pub I'm afraid), I am much happier having a potter along a nice grassy rural footpath. In this kind of environment I am much more open for an adventure. I don't have any recall so I will need an owner who is happy to keep me on a lead unless in a nice secure and safe place. If my new owner had a good sized grassy garden where I could run to my heart content that would be ideal - as boy I run fast when my little legs get going!
I will need a home that doesn't have a lot of visitors or strangers walking past as this makes me anxious and I will bark. It is best if I do meet any visitors outside of the home first as I may try and protect you and nip at their feet.
I thrive on routine, and would love some one on one attention. I am not suitable for children or cats and we would have to try another dog.
I am a gorgeous little boy who at the moment just isn't getting the attention I deserve, so I am hoping there will be a new home out there that's just perfect for me.

Howard is on our Home Direct Scheme, which means he will remain with his current family until a suitable match is found and all meets will be done here at the centre.

He loves getting out and about for a good long walk, where his excitable side comes out if he spots other dogs. While he can be a little bouncy around them at first, he enjoys having a play once he’s had a proper introduction.

He’s quite a chilled-out lad at home and is happy to settle down after his adventures. Buddy isn’t suited to living with cats, but he’d thrive in a home where he can enjoy the company of people and, ideally, have some doggy pals to play with while on his walks outside . He’s comfortable being left alone for a few hours, making him a good fit for households that might not always be around. His ideal adopters will need to have secure, high fencing (6ft to 9ft) in their garden, as Buddy has been known to be a bit of an escape artist.

Food is one of Buddy’s favourite things, and his love of treats makes him keen to learn and a joy to train. Whether he’s snoozing by your side, heading out on a walk, or enjoying his dinner, Buddy is simply a wonderful companion ready to bring happiness into a new home.

Buddy is part of our home direct scheme which means he is currently staying in his home until he finds a new one.",09/15/2025

Eddie here! I'm a really lovely, fun, happy boy and I'm looking forward to getting my paws in a forever home. I've been a racing Greyhound but I'm ready to put that life behind me and get started being a loved addition to someone's family.

I am a REALLY happy boy! My tail never stops wagging. I've loved making new friends and love to meet people and get cuddles from them. I'm a good boy out on my walks too. I've found that toys are super cool fun- especially the soft, squeaky teddy kind. I like if you throw it for me and then I can catch it and race off with it chucking it up in the air on my own!

In my new home, I possibly could live with another calm canine companion depending on how we got along at the Centre here. I'll be best not sharing my home with any small animals though. I could live with older children and I should be happy enough entertaining myself at home whilst you go out. Life for me in a home will come with some firsts but I'm sure I'll ace it all in no time!

Gaz has taken to retirement like a pro – he’s confident, curious, and more than ready for a loving forever home. He is currently in foster care.

Gaz is an affectionate and sociable boy who enjoys the company of people and takes everything in his stride. He loves getting out for his walks and exploring new sights and smells, and he’s polite on the lead too. He could bring a lot of fun and companionship to a home that’s ready for a dog with both heart and character.

He mixes well with other large dogs, and could potentially live with another similar-sized dog, pending introductions at the centre.

Due to his prey drive, Gaz will need a home without cats or small animals, but he’s more than happy being the centre of attention himself.

While we haven’t seen him interact with children directly, his confident and friendly nature suggests he could potentially live with older, respectful children, given careful introductions and the right match.

Gaz would love a home where he can enjoy daily walks, plenty of attention, and a comfy spot to stretch out and snooze after his adventures.

If you’re looking for a greyhound with personality, confidence, and plenty of love to give, Gaz might be just the dog for you. Come meet him – he’s ready to charm his way into your heart!",09/15/2025

Hi friends!! It’s Toby here...Toby the Tibetan! That’s right, I am a very handsome fluffy chap and a 5 year old Tibetan Mastiff. I’m on the lookout for my loving forever home so let me tell you all about me...

Getting to know me is something really quite special. You see, when you first meet me, I might not give too much away and will just be a gentle boy who likes to plod and mooch around. But...when we’ve built the start of a really cool friendship...I’ll show you even more and more of my personality! There’s definitely bundles of character beneath all this floof! Now I greet my friends with a big waggy tail, a play bow and a cheeky glint in my eye!

I love mooching around the paddocks here and getting stuck into all the smells. I also do like an occasional run and when I do my chops go flying in the wind! Don’t worry though...I don’t get up to very fast speeds and I’m not a massively high energy dog so there’ll be no need to whizz me off around an agility course. I’ll be more than chuffed with a garden to sunbathe and snooze in.

The more I’ve felt comfortable here the more I’ve shown a playful spirit and I do like playing with teddies and tuggies. I like getting up on my armchair and I think I’ll like to get my big ole paws back into a home. I like going out on walkies and I do like a car ride where I can watch the world go by out the window.

I’ll be looking for a pet free home ideally and where any children are older teenagers. I’ll be best suited to homes where someone is around most of the time but my human friends here can tell you a little more about that and what I’m looking for. If so far I’ve intrigued you and you think I could be the guy you’re looking for then I can’t wait to hear from you!!

Myself and my best friend Hettie are on the look out for a new forever home.
We are a lovely pair of older dogs who are very bonded and will make great additions to someone's family. We are both very friendly girls.
I am no trouble at all - great to walk, not bothered by traffic or other dogs, great for travelling in the car.....a real delight actually even if I do say so myself.
Like Hettie, I could live with a cat or another dog, and we are very friendly with children so would fit into most homes with no problem at all.
I am used to being clipped and groomed regularly. My teeth aren't too good I'm afraid, and I have had several teeth removed previously and the centre will be helping me again with my teeth, so I'm not sure how many I will have left soon! But don't let that put you off me, I really am the sweetest little girl.

I am very well mannered and gentle though, and great to handle. I am not bothered by much at all out on my walks, and am great at travelling in the car so will be up for all sorts of adventures with you.
I have lived with a cat briefly before, so could do again if the introductions were done slowly and carefully, and could possibly live with another dog as well.
My current owner says I am very ""comical"" with a great character. I love my bedtime, which is at 8pm, so don't expect me to be very active past that time!
I am getting a bit older now and do have a few fatty lumps and bumps and if I'm honest I could do with losing a bit of weight, so that could be something my new owners helps me with.

I am wondering if someone can help me...I'm looking for a foster home local to the centre here at Hayle whilst the vet team are undergoing some further investigatory work with me. It would be such a shame for me to have to stay here in kennels as I'm such a lovely sweet boy. Of course the team here are hoping that any Fosterer will of course fall in love with me and want to adopt me eventually.
I am in fact probably the friendliest boy you might ever meet! I adore human interactions and will smoother you with love and lots of slobber and kisses, especially if I am feeling a little anxious, as I tend to need some reassurance in new situations.
I am a excitable young dog, quite puppy like still, who can jump up quite a bit and I will need help with all my basic training, including learning to settle, but I am very quick to learn and very eager to please. If you watch me I will regularly check in with you to make sure all is ok and again for you to reassure me!
Being so young and playful I will need play and enrichment times to keep my spaniel brain occupied. I am a real fan of water and love my walks so we will be able to have so much fun together.
I'm not able to be vaccinated or neutered at the moment due to my ongoing health treatment so I will need to go to a home without cats and dogs. My friends here at the centre will be able to discuss my health needs with any suitable applicants.
If you think you could help a loveable boy like me please do apply, bye for now Cliff x",09/15/2025

I ended up at the rescue centre after being found as a stray and no one came to collect me. I don’t know why – I’m a total sweetheart! But that’s okay, because I believe there’s someone special out there just for me.

I’m a gentle, slightly squishy boy with a big heart and even bigger puppy eyes. I might be a little shy when we first meet – I just like to suss people out first – but give me a minute (and maybe a treat or two), and I’ll be snuggling into your side like we’ve known each other forever.

Once I know you’re my person, you’ll have a shadow for life. I love being with my humans. Fuss, cuddles, tummy rubs – I’m here for it all! I’m a quiet little goofball who brings smiles wherever I go. Everyone says I’ve got ""that face"" – you know, the one that melts hearts and brings happiness.

I might be able to live with a calm doggy friend (after some gentle intros), and I’d do well with older, steady-on-their-feet kids who know how to be kind. Cats? Waaay too exciting – better not!

So, if you’re looking for a loyal potato with a waggy tail, silly grin, and tons of love to give... I’m your Taco.

I might be a large dog, but I still think laps are made for me if there’s space, I’ll be right there. I love being stroked and fussed over, especially once I’ve had the chance to get to know you. I can be a bit shy at first with new people, especially in unfamiliar environments, but give me a little time and I’ll soon be leaning into you for attention and following you around the house like a shadow. I’m loyal, affectionate, and once I trust you, I’ll be your best friend for life.

I enjoy playtime and have lived happily with another dog before we played really well together! I do get a little territorial sometimes, though, so I need slow, calm introductions with any new dogs. Once I’ve made a friend, I love having a playmate to burn off some energy with. I’m not the kind of dog who wants a hectic dog park life I’d much rather go for quiet walks, sniff everything in sight, and come home for a cuddle.

I’ve also lived with children and got on well with them, especially those who understand that I sometimes need a bit of space and a calm environment. I’m sensitive and respond best to gentle voices, kind hands, and lots of love.

I’m looking for a new home because my current owner sadly isn’t able to keep me anymore. They love me very much and just want me to have the happy, full life I deserve with people who’ll cherish me and give me all the love I have to give in return.

If you’re looking for a loyal, loving companion who’ll stick by your side through thick and thin, I might be the perfect girl for you.

I’m a gentle, funny soul with buckets of personality. I’ve got this special way of making everyone smile – maybe it’s my goofy grin, or maybe it’s just the way I lean into fusses like they’re the best thing in the world.

I’m a real character who brings smiles wherever I go. I love to play – especially if there’s an agility tunnel involved! I zoom through those like a little rocket! I’m super clever too and love learning new things – show me a treat and I’m all ears (and paws!).

I adore humans and can’t get enough fuss and cuddles. Being near my favourite people is my happy place, and I’ll always be up for a cuddle or a game.

I could potentially live with another calm dog after some slow and steady introductions – I’ve got a lot of energy, so a chill buddy would be ideal. I haven’t met any cats, but with how excitable I am, it’s probably best we skip that one. I could definitely live with children who are steady on their feet – I think we could have loads of fun together!

I’m a charismatic leading man with star power and personality in spades. I love to be the center of attention, soaking up all the praise, belly rubs, and adoration I can get.

I'm always keen to meet new fans—humans and dogs alike! I’ve been working hard on sharing the limelight with other pups on walks and might even be open to a canine co-star at home, as long as we get to know each other properly at the rescue center first. But cats? Let’s just say they’re not on my guest list.

Now, every star has their quirks, and I’m no exception. I do need a home that can offer me structure, routine, and—most importantly—patience. I’m still learning how to handle the pressure of stardom, and when I get overwhelmed or frustrated, I’ve been known to nip and get myself into trouble. Because of this, I’m looking for an adult-only home where I can decompress and continue learning at my own pace, with people who understand I’m a work in progress.

But there’s more to me than just good looks—I’ve got a heart full of love waiting for the right person to share it with.

I travel really well in the car so the world could be our oyster!
The team here have been doing lots of work with me to help keep me calm as I can be a bit too boisterous and can get over stimulated easily and tend to be a bit grabby. Because of this I will need to live with adults only.
Not only am I gorgeous looking I also have the brains, and really enjoy my training. I already know sit, down, paw and wait. It would be great if my new owners can provide with me with lots of enrichment activities to keep my brain busy.
I generally walk really well on the lead, only getting a bit strong when I see other dogs in the distance that I really want to be friends with. The team think a similar female sized dog in the home might be a good idea for me, she might be able to show me a thing or two.
I love to play with my toys and one of my favourite places to go to is the beach - I am a bit of a water baby! I will just need a bit more work on my recall.

I am looking for new owners with either experience of super smart dogs like me or at least new owners who are willing to follow the guidance from the team here.
I am a gorgeous looking boy but there is much more to me than just the good looks ,and I really need my new owners to be patient with me and let me settle into my new home gradually.
Once I feel comfortable I do settle well in the home, am perfectly clean, and don't mind being left alone.
However, I do get anxious and overwhelmed when I'm out and about in busy places so my new owners will need to be sensitive of this and introduce me slowly and be considerate of where I go. I particularly like woodland walks and fields or anywhere where there is water as I am a bit of a water baby!
I do have pretty good recall.....unless I see a bird to chase!
I get excited when I see other dogs out on my walks but I really want to play. I have have had some great play dates here with some of my kennel friends so the team really believe I would suit a home with another dog, as long as that dog is able to cope with a playful boy like me!
I tend to become anxious if I meet a dog that is barky towards me, so my new owners will need to help me feel more comfortable in situations like this.
I will need regular grooming to keep me looking as handsome as I do so it would be great if my new owner would be open to doing this in my new home gradually with the guidance of the team here at the centre. It's just that I find the grooming salon too stressful and not an enjoyable experience. I am muzzle trained and I will need to wear this at vet appointments and at grooming times. The team are working with me currently so that I am comfortable in wearing my muzzle when just out on normal walks. I don't like strangers approaching me, they make me feel uncomfortable and I could possibly snap, so the muzzle would keep everybody safe.
Once I know you I can form a really lovely bond, and I become very affectionate. My original owner was a lady by herself and this suited me very well. The team have seen me thrive on a one to one basis, so a single person home may suit me best again, although the team here are open to discussing me with all applicants.
I do love to play but prefer to parade around with my toys myself instead of lots of fetch. The staff here think I would thrive in a home with a large garden or outdoor space. I am also a really clever chap and love learning new things and thrive on keeping my brain busy by trying out lots of new enrichment activities.
If you think you are a good match for I cant wait to hear from you, love Merlyn x

Shep is a bright and beautiful 1-year-old dog who is currently thriving in a loving foster home. He’s full of personality, incredibly intelligent, and always up for a challenge – whether it’s learning a new trick or exploring the great outdoors.

Shep is looking for an active home where he can continue to grow and shine. He thrives on structure, routine, and positive reinforcement training, so his ideal family will be one that enjoys ongoing training and has experience with dogs who like to keep their minds busy.

Shep can sometimes get overwhelmed or overexcited in certain situations, particularly around unfamiliar people, dogs, or environments. However, he’s making great progress in his foster home with the right support. With patience, consistency, and understanding, Shep will reward you with loyalty, love, and lots of laughs.

Shep would do best in an adult-only home or one with older teenagers who understand the needs of a high-energy, intelligent dog.

I’m a gorgeous nearly 2 year old German Shepherd Cross. I’ve got a heart full of love and a playful spirit! I’m looking for my forever home where I can thrive with an experienced and patient owner.

I adore humans of all ages and having previously lived with children, I’m pretty good at playing with them and being their best friend.
I love to learn and I thrive on positive reinforcement, which is good because I do have some training needs that you could help me with. I’m quite strong on the lead, so I would benefit from some lead training. I’m also a little under socialised when it comes to other dogs outside the home and I can be a little reactive when meeting them at first, so I will need an owner who is confident with handling my strength and my social needs.

Although I have previously lived with another dog in the home, he didn’t like me very much, so I would really love to be the only dog in the home so I can get all of the attention on me!
I would need to be the only pet in the home as cats are far too much fun to chase and sometimes, even little dogs excite me too much too so it is best that I don’t live with any small animals.
If you’ve got time, love, and a little bit of patience to share, I’ll reward you with all the cuddles, tail wags, and loyalty you could ever want.
I am being rehomed through the Home Direct scheme, so you won’t find me in a kennel at the centre but I will meet my potential adopters there.

If you’re looking for a playful, loving companion who will light up your life, Marley could be the one for you, please get in touch with us today to arrange a visit!",09/15/2025

At just one year old, she has a gentle nature and endless affection.

Special Features:
• Affection: Pearl thrives on love and attention.
• Playful Spirit: Pearl loves toys, games, and exploring the world with curiosity.
• Dog-Friendly: She gets along well with other dogs and could happily join a home with a similar sized companion.
• Kid-Approved: Pearl’s gentle demeanour makes her a great match for families with children but she is still a puppy so can be bouncy!

Ideal Home:
Pearl would love a home where someone is around most of the day to shower her with love and help her continue her training. She’s eager to learn and please, and with a little guidance, she’ll grow into the most loyal companion you could ask for.

I'm a beautiful boy who loves to play, explore and, most importantly, hang out with my favourite people. I'm super friendly and love to be with people, so you'll always find me hanging out right at the front of my kennel, trying to grab everyone's attention so they'll come over and make friends with me. Really, I can't understand why they would want to pay attention to anything other than me anyway, just look at me - I'm amazing! When I'm not busy socialising, I enjoy playing with all my toys and tucking into some tasty treats.

I'm looking for a home where I'll be able to spend a lot of time with my owner because life is just more fun when I'm with a friend. I'm looking forward to days out in the park, running around having fun before coming back home to crash out on the sofa for a well earned rest. It could be fun for me to live with another dog, if we do some meets and get on well, but I would rather no live with a cat and of course, I'd love a garden to run around in too.

It's Hippo here! I'm a loving little lad looking to get my paws into the stability of a forever home. I love to be around people! I enjoy making new friends and my tail wags so fast when I can make a new friend. I love a cuddle and I do consider myself to be a little bit of a lap dog...even though I'm quite a stocky boy! It might be hard to tell from my pictures but I'm not a very big boy so I'm a smaller Bulldog cross.

I love my food and I like doing my food puzzles hunting out all the tasty snacks. I'm not too fussed about toys at the moment but I think once I'm happy at home I will be. Because I really love being with people, I find it really hard to be away from them so at the moment I'm finding it difficult to settle on my own. Once I'm with you, I love to just hang out and have a nap. Hopefully once I'm settled at home and I learn that you're always coming back for me, I'll learn that being alone isn't so bad after all. My human friends here will be happy to tell you all about that.

I might be able to live with another dog depending on how we got along at the Centre and I don't know how I'll feel about a feline friend but maybe I could try that too. I could live with older children but I will need a home where someone can dedicate a lot of time to helping me feel brave being left so where my time alone time can be built up slowly.

I could potentially share a home with another dog, but I can’t say the same for tiny, fluffy creatures.
A home with a garden or some outdoor space where I could freely have my zoomies or leisurely potter around would truly make me happy.

I’m a little shy at the moment as it’s been a big change but I am happy to have a fuss and get zoomies when my breakfast arrives! I’m sure I’ll get my confidence back in no time once I’m settled.

I’m currently living with the most amazing foster human (seriously, they’re the best!) and I’ve been having the time of my life learning all the important stuff that makes me a really good boy.

The other day, we chilled outside a café and did some top-tier people-watching. I just laid down, soaked up the vibes, and even said a polite hello to a toddler – sat calmly and everything! Kids don’t faze me when I’m on the lead – I’m pretty chilled like that.

Let’s talk house manners: I’m totally house trained (yep, not a single accident in my foster home – go me!) and I can hold my toilet like a champ. I loooove my yak chews and snuggling up for a cuddle – I’m a professional cuddle bug, no doubt about it.

Walks? I walk beautifully on the lead, and I’ve started learning off-lead recall too – I’m getting pretty confident, so I’d love someone who’s up for continuing that with me when I settle in. I’m also fab with other dogs, big and small. I do get excited and think every dog might want to be my best friend, but I’m learning that sometimes we just walk on by. I’m smart, so I’ll get it.

Strangers? Oh, I’ve got a new move – I just sit on their feet and wait for a scratch. Works every time. And guess what? I haven’t even barked once – not even a little woof!

I am a Patterdale x Spaniel so with those breeds you can probably imagine what a busy little girl I am!! So I am hoping to find an active new family who can keep up with me and give me a forever home as I have sadly been passed through several homes already.
I don't sit still for long when I am out and about as everything is so much fun, so I will need a home that not only can provide the physical exercise but also the mental stimulation for me as I am also super smart and love learning new things and trying out new enrichment activities too!
I can be vocal with new people, but once I do know you I am very sweet, really affectionate and love a cuddle... sometimes I will press myself into you to get the most out of our cuddles! A home with adults only would be best for me as I have had a couple of nipping incidents and no cats or other small animals as I have a really high prey drive. Another dog may be a possibility as I have been out walking with some friends here at the centre and I have even been off the lead with another dog too and I was such a good girl! On my walks, I will be barky if other dogs are reacting towards me as I am a sensitive girl really.
I will need a very secure garden as I am quick as a flash especially if I see something that interests me, the staff here are working on my recall but I will need to remain on a long line for now, and I will pull forward on the lead so the team are helping me with that too.
I like to play and am nice and gentle but I will run off with my toys so don't expect to play a game of fetch!!
A home in a quieter location may be better for me as I can be a bit worried by traffic and I am a lover of countryside walks as they have lots of smells for me to sniff and lots of places for me to explore... If there is a stream or river that's even better as I love water too!

Life hasn’t always been easy for me, and because of that, I’ve developed some behaviours that need understanding, patience, and the right guidance.

The amazing team at the centre has been working so hard to help me overcome my struggles, and I’ve made great progress! But to make sure my transition into a new home goes smoothly, my future family will need to visit me multiple times—both at the centre and at home—to help us build trust and set me up for success.

I need an experienced owner who understands resource guarding and is willing to put in the time and effort to help me feel safe and secure. I won’t be able to live with children, and I’d do best as the only pet in the home—but don’t worry, I love playing with other dogs when we’re out and about!

I love toys, splashing in the water, and getting fuss from my closest humans, and I promise that for the right person, I will be an incredibly rewarding companion.
